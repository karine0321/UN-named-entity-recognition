not	O
be	O
tolerated	O
regardless	O
of	O
the	O
area	O
where	O
this	O
is	O
taking	O
place	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
what	O
is	O
required	O
is	O
zero	O
tolerance	O
for	O
terrorism	O
regardless	O
of	O
its	O
intended	O
targets	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
without	O
reason	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
reiterating	O
this	O
point	O
.	O

For	O
us	O
in	O
Ethiopia	I-LOC
,	O
terrorism	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
theoretical	O
threat	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
practical	O
and	O
immediate	O
threat	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
face	O
both	O
before	O
and	O
after	O
11	O
September	O
,	O
including	O
most	O
recently	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
our	O
earnest	O
hope	O
that	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
will	O
do	O
whatever	O
is	O
necessary	O
to	O
eliminate	O
this	O
scourge	O
.	O

We	O
also	O
hope	O
that	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
better	O
days	O
ahead	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
will	O
all	O
concentrate	O
on	O
addressing	O
the	O
challenges	O
that	O
trouble	O
our	O
planet	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
conclude	O
by	O
renewing	O
Ethiopia	I-LOC
's	O
commitment	O
to	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
and	O
to	O
what	O
it	O
stands	O
for	O
.	O

We	O
wish	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
become	O
an	O
even	O
a	O
more	O
effective	O
universal	O
Organization	I-ORG
and	O
a	O
more	O
forceful	O
and	O
faithful	O
custodian	O
of	O
the	O
principles	O
of	O
international	O
law	O
.	O

Our	O
hope	O
and	O
our	O
dream	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
will	O
be	O
an	O
even	O
more	O
robust	O
universal	O
Organization	I-ORG
catering	O
to	O
the	O
legitimate	O
interests	O
of	O
both	O
big	O
and	O
small	O
counties	O
.	O

We	O
in	O
Ethiopia	I-LOC
will	O
continue	O
to	O
contribute	O
our	O
share	O
to	O
the	O
greater	O
nurturing	O
of	O
multilateralism	O
and	O
to	O
making	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
an	O
effective	O
custodian	O
of	O
those	O
