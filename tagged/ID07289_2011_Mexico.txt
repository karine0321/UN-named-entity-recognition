out	O
Mexico	I-LOC

a	O
country	O

The	O

faces	O
major	O

about	O
which	O
we	O
have	O

We	O

about	O
terrorism	O

and	O

We	O
know	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
afflicted	O
by	O
other	O
problems	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
global	O
economic	O
crisis	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
refer	O
to	O
just	O
a	O
few	O
of	O
them	O
now	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
aware	O
that	O
our	O
duty	O
is	O
to	O
strengthen	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
,	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
less	O
bureaucratic	O
and	O
to	O
once	O
again	O
turn	O
this	O
into	O
an	O
Organization	I-ORG
that	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
tackle	O
the	O
pressing	O
challenges	O
of	O
our	O
time	O
.	O

Faced	O
with	O
this	O
reality	O
,	O
Mexico	I-LOC
is	O
shouldering	O
its	O
international	O
responsibilities	O
firmly	O
and	O
with	O
determination	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
now	O
like	O
to	O
refer	O
to	O
the	O
problem	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
today	O
most	O
afflicts	O
the	O
poorest	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

More	O
than	O
1	O
billion	O
people	O
,	O
on	O
every	O
continent	O
,	O
are	O
living	O
on	O
less	O
than	O
$1	O
.	O
25	O
a	O
day	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
problem	O
of	O
poverty	O
.	O

Over	O
the	O
past	O
five	O
years	O
,	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
food	O
has	O
risen	O
by	O
more	O
than	O
50	O
per	O
cent	O
.	O

Over	O
the	O
past	O
12	O
months	O
,	O
the	O
average	O
increase	O
has	O
been	O
26	O
per	O
cent	O
.	O

This	O
means	O
that	O
the	O
poorest	O
families	O
,	O
who	O
allocate	O
most	O
of	O
their	O
income	O
to	O
food	O
,	O
have	O
sunk	O
even	O
deeper	O
into	O
poverty	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
why	O
poverty	O
has	O
increased	O
around	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
why	O
we	O
once	O
again	O
see	O
famine	O
in	O
the	O
Horn	I-LOC
of	I-LOC
Africa	I-LOC
,	O
in	O
various	O
nations	O
on	O
that	O
continent	O
,	O
in	O
Asia	I-LOC
and	O
in	O
Latin	I-LOC
America	I-LOC
.	O

This	O
is	O
why	O
,	O
in	O
addition	O
to	O
the	O
democratic	O
awakening	O
of	O
certain	O
nations	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
seen	O
many	O
people	O
suffering	O
from	O
hunger	O
who	O
have	O
taken	O
to	O
the	O
streets	O
.	O

Hunger	O
is	O
what	O
has	O
,	O
in	O
many	O
cases	O
,	O
awakened	O
their	O
awareness	O
of	O
democracy	O
.	O

Why	O
the	O
hike	O
in	O
food	O
prices	O
?	O

That	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
question	O
we	O
must	O
ask	O
ourselves	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
partly	O
because	O
developing	O
countries	O
have	O
grown	O
rapidly	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
thing	O
.	O

China	I-LOC
,	O
India	I-LOC
and	O
many	O
others	O
have	O
reached	O
growth	O
rates	O
that	O
allow	O
their	O
people	O
to	O
have	O
greater	O
access	O
to	O
food	O
.	O

What	O
is	O
left	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
to	O
develop	O
the	O
necessary	O
technology	O
to	O
increase	O
our	O
capacity	O
to	O
produce	O
food	O
.	O

Secondly	O
,	O
drought	O
and	O
climate	O
change	O
have	O
been	O
other	O
contributing	O
factors	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
not	O
truly	O
realized	O
that	O
climate	O
change	O
is	O
a	O
serious	O
threat	O
to	O
humankind	O
as	O
a	O
whole	O
.	O

In	O
particular	O
,	O
climate	O
change	O
is	O
behind	O
the	O
drought	O
that	O
has	O
restricted	O
food	O
production	O
in	O
recent	O
years	O
.	O

Thirdly	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
financial	O
speculation	O
and	O
speculation	O
on	O
the	O
financial	O
markets	O
.	O

Let	O
me	O
point	O
to	O
one	O
bit	O
of	O
data	O
.	O

In	O
1987	O
,	O
financial	O
agents	O
and	O
companies	O
bought	O
just	O
7	O
per	O
cent	O
of	O
food	O
on	O
the	O
world	O
markets	O
.	O

Today	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
30	O
per	O
cent	O
of	O
sales	O
of	O
corn	O
and	O
wheat	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
are	O
made	O
by	O
financial	O
companies	O
.	O

Why	O
do	O
they	O
want	O
corn	O
and	O
wheat	O
?	O

Is	O
it	O
to	O
trade	O
them	O
on	O
various	O
markets	O
or	O
to	O
distribute	O
them	O
to	O
certain	O
regions	O
?	O

Of	O
course	O
not	O
.	O

Trade	O
companies	O
and	O
distributors	O
buy	O
70	O
per	O
cent	O
of	O
wheat	O
and	O
corn	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
remaining	O
30	O
per	O
cent	O
is	O
bought	O
by	O
financial	O
firms	O
with	O
one	O
specific	O
purpose	O
in	O
mind	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
speculation	O
.	O

We	O
see	O
how	O
they	O
buy	O
and	O
sell	O
the	O
rights	O
to	O
food	O
with	O
the	O
sole	O
intent	O
of	O
driving	O
up	O
market	O
prices	O
,	O
when	O
thousands	O
of	O
children	O
are	O
dying	O
of	O
hunger	O
across	O
the	O
various	O
continents	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
someone	O
who	O
believes	O
in	O
markets	O
,	O
economic	O
freedom	O
and	O
enterprise	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
also	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
time	O
has	O
come	O
for	O
restrictions	O
to	O
be	O
imposed	O
on	O
unbridled	O
markets	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
also	O
behind	O
world	O
hunger	O
.	O

The	O
second	O
challenge	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
refer	O
to	O
is	O
drug	O
trafficking	O
and	O
international	O
organized	O
crime	O
.	O

Everyone	O
is	O
surprised	O
by	O
the	O
dozens	O
,	O
hundreds	O
and	O
even	O
thousands	O
of	O
deaths	O
caused	O
by	O
repressive	O
authoritarian	O
regimes	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
we	O
also	O
repudiate	O
these	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
also	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
aware	O
that	O
organized	O
crime	O
today	O
is	O
killing	O
more	O
people	O
—	O
and	O
more	O
young	O
people	O
—	O
than	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
current	O
dictatorial	O
regimes	O
put	O
together	O
.	O

Today	O
,	O
thousands	O
of	O
people	O
—	O
tens	O
of	O
thousands	O
of	O
people	O
in	O
Latin	I-LOC
America	I-LOC
,	O
in	O
particular	O
between	O
Mexico	I-LOC
and	O
the	O
Andes	I-LOC
—	O
are	O
dying	O
because	O
of	O
criminals	O
.	O

I	O
greet	O
with	O
affection	O
and	O
respect	O
my	O
colleagues	O
from	O
Central	I-LOC
and	O
Latin	I-LOC
America	I-LOC
who	O
are	O
here	O
today	O
.	O

Today	O
,	O
the	O
world	O
faces	O
the	O
challenge	O
of	O
unscrupulous	O
criminals	O
who	O
have	O
no	O
respect	O
for	O
borders	O
and	O
who	O
do	O
grave	O
harm	O
to	O
the	O
citizens	O
of	O
many	O
nations	O
.	O

The	O
power	O
of	O
crime	O
is	O
stronger	O
than	O
many	O
Governments	O
,	O
although	O
assuredly	O
not	O
ours	O
.	O

This	O
stems	O
from	O
two	O
fundamental	O
factors	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
the	O
exorbitant	O
profits	O
that	O
flow	O
from	O
drug	O
trafficking	O
and	O
unlimited	O
access	O
to	O
the	O
purchase	O
of	O
powerful	O
weapons	O
.	O

With	O
respect	O
to	O
weapons	O
,	O
why	O
do	O
criminals	O
have	O
unrestricted	O
access	O
to	O
AK-47s	O
,	O
R-15s	O
and	O
grenade	O
launchers	O
?	O

In	O
my	O
view	O
,	O
having	O
fiercely	O
fought	O
criminals	O
and	O
having	O
seized	O
120,000	O
weapons	O
in	O
five	O
years	O
,	O
the	O
answer	O
can	O
be	O
summed	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
single	O
word	O
,	O
profits	O
—	O
the	O
runaway	O
profits	O
of	O
an	O
arms	O
industry	O
that	O
sees	O
in	O
every	O
war	O
,	O
whether	O
a	O
civil	O
war	O
in	O
some	O
distant	O
country	O
or	O
a	O
battle	O
among	O
criminals	O
,	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
sell	O
ever	O
more	O
weapons	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
urgent	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
place	O
serious	O
controls	O
in	O
countries	O
that	O
produce	O
and	O
sell	O
high-power	O
weaponry	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
prevent	O
them	O
from	O
filling	O
the	O
arsenals	O
of	O
organized	O
crime	O

The	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
has	O
its	O
work	O
cut	O
out	O
for	O
it	O
in	O
that	O
regard	O

The	O
United	I-ORG

must	O
continue	O
to	O
promote	O
the	O

the	O

Unfortunately	O
,	O
the	O
demand	O
for	O
drugs	O
in	O
those	O

to	O

We	O
must	O
recognize	O
that	O
so	O

Today	O
more	O
than	O

drug-consuming	O

must	O
undertake	O
effective	O
efforts	O

radically	O
reduce	O
demand	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
argued	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
impossible	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
demand	O
for	O
drugs	O
is	O
continuing	O
to	O
rise	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
the	O
case	O
here	O

where	O
nearly	O

parts	O

What	O
is	O
the	O
solution	O
?	O

I	O
can	O
honestly	O
say	O
that	O
even	O
if	O
those	O
countries	O
are	O
unable	O
or	O
unwilling	O
to	O
reduce	O
their	O
demand	O
for	O

if	O
they	O
are	O
resigned	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
continue	O
to	O
rise	O
,	O
they	O
still	O
have	O
a	O
moral	O
obligation	O
to	O
reduce	O
the	O
huge	O
profits	O
that	O
drug	O
traffickers	O
obtain	O
from	O
that	O

would	O
be	O

but	O
failing	O
that	O

a	O
way	O
to	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
we	O
created	O
a	O

methods	O
for	O
reducing	O
emissions	O
caused	O

In	O
Mexico	I-LOC

more	O

12	O

who	O
make	O

With	O
the	O
approach	O
of	O
the	O
seventeenth	O
Conference	I-MISC
of	I-MISC
the	I-MISC
Parties	I-MISC
,	O
in	O
Durban	I-LOC
,	O
we	O
fear	O
that	O
without	O
sufficient	O
political	O
leadership	O
and	O
commitment	O
to	O
its	O
own	O
Convention	I-MISC
by	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
,	O
we	O
may	O
lose	O
part	O
of	O
what	O
we	O
have	O
achieved	O
in	O
the	O
battle	O
against	O
climate	O
change	O
.	O

We	O
must	O
advance	O
within	O
the	O
Kyoto	I-MISC
Protocol	I-MISC
,	O
keeping	O
in	O
mind	O
that	O
the	O
provisions	O
of	O
annex	O
1	O
expire	O
next	O
year	O
.	O

What	O
will	O
happen	O
with	O
our	O
environmental	O
obligations	O
in	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
the	O
failure	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
relevant	O
nations	O
to	O
take	O
action	O
?	O

The	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
fight	O
climate	O
change	O
is	O
to	O
break	O
with	O
the	O
false	O
argument	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
choose	O
between	O
economic	O
growth	O
and	O
combating	O
climate	O
change	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
in	O
fact	O
perfectly	O
compatible	O
.	O

Through	O
actions	O
that	O
build	O
sustainable	O
development	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
simultaneously	O
reduce	O
poverty	O
and	O
climate	O
change	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
another	O
challenge	O
is	O
the	O
social	O
basis	O
for	O
reducing	O
poverty	O
and	O
marginalization	O
.	O

In	O
Mexico	I-LOC
we	O
established	O
a	O
programme	O
for	O
transferring	O
money	O
to	O
the	O
poorest	O
of	O
our	O
population	O
,	O
with	O
incentives	O
for	O
mothers	O
who	O
take	O
their	O
children	O
to	O
school	O
or	O
health	O
clinics	O
.	O

The	O
programme	O
offers	O
an	O
average	O
of	O
$80	O
monthly	O
to	O
the	O
bottom	O
fourth	O
of	O
Mexico	I-LOC
's	O
poorest	O
families	O
,	O
benefiting	O
more	O
than	O
30	O
million	O
people	O
and	O
reducing	O
extreme	O
poverty	O
in	O
our	O
country	O
by	O
nearly	O
50	O
per	O
cent	O
between	O
1995	O
and	O
2010	O
.	O

Recently	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
focused	O
on	O
guaranteeing	O
the	O
health	O
of	O
all	O
Mexicans	I-MISC
.	O

In	O
five	O
years	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
added	O
2,000	O
new	O
hospitals	O
and	O
clinics	O
,	O
reconstructed	O
2	O
,000	O
more	O
and	O
introduced	O
a	O
national	O
health	O
policy	O
that	O
already	O
covers	O
more	O
than	O
100,000	O
people	O
.	O

This	O
allows	O
Mexico	I-LOC
to	O
proudly	O
state	O
today	O
in	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
that	O
this	O
year	O
we	O
will	O
achieve	O
universal	O
health	O
insurance	O
,	O
covering	O
doctors	O
,	O
medicines	O
,	O
treatment	O
and	O
hospitalization	O
for	O
any	O
Mexican	O
who	O
needs	O
them	O
.	O

That	O
achievement	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
are	O
proud	O
,	O
confirms	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
Mexico	I-LOC
has	O
already	O
achieved	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
Millennium	I-MISC
Development	I-MISC
Goals	I-MISC
to	O
which	O
it	O
committed	O
itself	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
now	O
like	O
to	O
discuss	O
a	O
crucial	O
issue	O
that	O
has	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
transformation	O
and	O
modernization	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
.	O

The	O
conflict	O
in	O
the	O
Middle	I-LOC
East	I-LOC
is	O
a	O
matter	O
that	O
has	O
clearly	O
tested	O
the	O
capacity	O
of	O
the	O
Organization	I-ORG
.	O

We	O
are	O
particularly	O
concerned	O
about	O
the	O
stalemate	O
in	O
negotiations	O
between	O
Israel	I-LOC
and	O
the	O
Palestinian	I-ORG
National	I-ORG
Authority	I-ORG
.	O

The	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
bears	O
the	O
responsibility	O
for	O
making	O
a	O
constructive	O
contribution	O
to	O
the	O
peaceful	O
resolution	O
of	O
this	O
conflict	O
—	O
one	O
that	O
makes	O
possible	O
the	O
existence	O
of	O
two	O
States	I-LOC
,	O
reaffirms	O
the	O
recognition	O
of	O
Israel	I-LOC
's	O
right	O
to	O
exist	O
and	O
makes	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
a	O
Palestinian	I-MISC
State	O
a	O
reality	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
bear	O
in	O
mind	O
that	O
this	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
genuine	O
,	O
viable	O
and	O
negotiated	O
solution	O
in	O
which	O
legitimate	O
and	O
balanced	O
mediation	O
plays	O
a	O
fundamental	O
role	O
.	O

Such	O
a	O
solution	O
must	O
also	O
be	O
politically	O
and	O
economically	O
viable	O
and	O
enable	O
Israel	I-LOC
and	O
Palestine	I-LOC
to	O
truly	O
exist	O
side	O
by	O
side	O
in	O
peace	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
new	O
generations	O
of	O
Israelis	I-MISC
and	O
Palestinians	I-MISC
can	O
truly	O
know	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
live	O
together	O
without	O
hatred	O
or	O
violence	O
.	O

We	O
should	O
also	O
remember	O
that	O
no	O
solution	O
can	O
be	O
found	O
while	O
either	O
of	O
the	O
sides	O
,	O
explicitly	O
or	O
implicitly	O
,	O
desires	O
the	O
annihilation	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
make	O
progress	O
on	O
compliance	O
with	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
resolutions	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
policies	O
that	O
we	O
all	O
know	O
are	O
contrary	O
to	O
international	O
law	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
vital	O
that	O
we	O
move	O
forward	O
together	O
in	O
transforming	O
and	O
modernizing	O
the	O
Organization	I-ORG
.	O

It	O
is	O
an	O
excellent	O
thing	O
that	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
building	O
is	O
being	O
renovated	O
;	O
now	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
modernize	O
the	O
Organization	I-ORG
at	O
its	O
core	O
.	O

It	O
must	O
not	O
fail	O
in	O
its	O
commitment	O
to	O
history	O
and	O
humankind	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
time	O
that	O
all	O
Member	O
States	O
play	O
our	O
parts	O
in	O
ensuring	O
that	O
the	O
Organization	I-ORG
has	O
the	O
strength	O
and	O
viability	O
that	O
it	O
needs	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
lacks	O
.	O

There	O
have	O
been	O
many	O
occasions	O
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
has	O
been	O
paralysed	O
by	O
the	O
tyranny	O
of	O
consensus	O
,	O
where	O
a	O
minority	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
defeat	O
a	O
large	O
majority	O
.	O

Consensus	O
must	O
no	O
longer	O
be	O
seen	O
as	O
the	O
veto	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
obstinate	O
;	O
rather	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
understood	O
as	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
building	O
shared	O
and	O
genuinely	O
legitimate	O
solutions	O
that	O
reflect	O
the	O
will	O
of	O
the	O
majority	O

Keeping	O
the	O

also	O
necessarily	O
implies	O
the	O
reform	O
of	O
the	O
