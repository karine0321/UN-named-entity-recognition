more	O
important	O
than	O

the	O

Bulgaria	I-LOC
is	O
firmly	O
convinced	O
that	O
in	O
order	O
for	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
to	O
play	O
its	O
role	O
effectively	O
worldwide	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
steadfastly	O
pursue	O
the	O
radical	O
reforms	O
identified	O
at	O
the	O
2005	O
World	I-MISC
Summit	I-MISC
.	O

Progress	O
was	O
achieved	O
at	O
the	O
sixty-first	O
session	O
,	O
but	O
much	O
remains	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
reforms	O
meet	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
's	O
hopes	O
.	O

Despite	O
the	O
good-faith	O
efforts	O
of	O
the	O
mediators	O
,	O
no	O
tangible	O
progress	O
has	O
been	O
seen	O
on	O
a	O
question	O
that	O
has	O
been	O
discussed	O
at	O
length:	O
reform	O
of	O
the	O
Security	I-ORG
Council	I-ORG
.	O

My	O
delegation	O
supports	O
the	O
recommendation	O
to	O
move	O
this	O
process	O
forward	O
to	O
the	O
negotiation	O
phase	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
view	O
to	O
reaching	O
a	O
broadly	O
acceptable	O
compromise	O
that	O
would	O
take	O
account	O
of	O
equitable	O
geographic	O
representation	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
obvious	O
that	O
reform	O
of	O
the	O
Council	I-ORG
will	O
not	O
be	O
an	O
easy	O
task	O
.	O

We	O
will	O
require	O
interim	O
solutions	O
at	O
various	O
stages	O
over	O
a	O
certain	O
period	O
of	O
time	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
step	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
cannot	O
be	O
put	O
off	O
indefinitely	O
,	O
because	O
if	O
we	O
are	O
unable	O
to	O
reform	O
the	O
Security	I-ORG
Council	I-ORG
,	O
then	O
broad	O
reform	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
will	O
be	O
incomplete	O
.	O

A	O
critical	O
consideration	O
of	O
the	O
implementation	O
of	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
pilot	O
countries	O
in	O
the	O
One	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
Initiative	O
has	O
revealed	O
positive	O
results	O
.	O

But	O
consensus	O
has	O
yet	O
to	O
emerge	O
on	O
how	O
to	O
further	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
attaining	O
system-wide	O
coherence	O
in	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
.	O

We	O
hope	O
that	O
the	O
final	O
outcome	O
will	O
take	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
improved	O
and	O
increased	O
development	O
assistance	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
go	O
together	O
with	O
a	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
synergy	O
in	O
the	O
concerned	O
countries	O
and	O
the	O
competent	O
structures	O
.	O

In	O
conclusion	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
recognize	O
that	O
progress	O
has	O
been	O
made	O
in	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
reform	O
areas	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
have	O
not	O
yet	O
achieved	O
enough	O
.	O

Bulgaria	I-LOC
expects	O
that	O
the	O
remaining	O
tasks	O
on	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
reform	O
agenda	O
will	O
be	O
pursued	O
energetically	O
and	O
without	O
delay	O
.	O

To	O
that	O
end	O
we	O
appeal	O
to	O
Member	O
States	O
to	O
show	O
more	O
flexibility	O
on	O
the	O
decisions	O
needed	O
to	O
ensure	O
the	O
consistency	O
of	O
the	O
reform	O
process	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
in	O
our	O
common	O
interest	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
the	O
sixty-second	O
session	O
is	O
a	O
success	O
.	O

So	O
let	O
us	O
work	O
together	O
and	O
with	O
goodwill	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
happen	O
.	O
