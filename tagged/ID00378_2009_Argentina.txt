I	O
must	O
confess	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
arrived	O
in	O
this	O
city	O
to	O
participate	O
in	O
this	O
session	O
of	O
the	O
General	I-ORG
Assembly	I-ORG
,	O
I	O
had	O
intended	O
to	O
begin	O
my	O
statement	O
with	O
a	O
strong	O
appeal	O
on	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
rebuild	O
multilateralism	O
and	O
cooperation	O
as	O
the	O
two	O
basic	O
instruments	O
to	O
overcome	O
what	O
today	O
is	O
undoubtedly	O
the	O
central	O
issue	O
in	O
our	O
global	O
discussion	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
overcoming	O
the	O
social	O
and	O
economic	O
crisis	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
certain	O
events	O
on	O
Monday	O
and	O
Tuesday	O
oblige	O
me	O
to	O
begin	O
my	O
statement	O
by	O
reporting	O
that	O
the	O
Embassy	O
of	O
the	O
Argentine	I-MISC
Republic	O
in	O
Tegucigalpa	I-LOC
,	O
Republic	O
of	O
Honduras	I-LOC
,	O
had	O
its	O
electricity	O
cut	O
off	O
some	O
two	O
days	O
ago	O
.	O

That	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
because	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
paid	O
the	O
bill	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
for	O
far	O
more	O
serious	O
reasons	O
.	O

Next	O
to	O
the	O
Argentine	I-MISC
Embassy	O
is	O
a	O
television	O
studio	O
which	O
broadcast	O
the	O
news	O
of	O
President	O
Zelaya	I-PER
's	O
arrival	O
in	O
Honduras	I-LOC
,	O
the	O
repression	O
and	O
the	O
demonstrations	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
democracy	O
.	O

That	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
.	O

In	O
any	O
event	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
had	O
better	O
luck	O
than	O
the	O
Embassy	O
of	O
the	O
sister	O
Republic	O
of	O
Brazil	I-LOC
,	O
where	O
,	O
at	O
an	O
early	O
stage	O
they	O
cut	O
off	O
not	O
only	O
the	O
electricity	O
but	O
the	O
water	O
as	O
well	O
—	O
for	O
having	O
given	O
shelter	O
to	O
the	O
constitutional	O
President	O
,	O
Manuel	I-PER
Zelaya	I-PER
.	O

As	O
a	O
Latin	I-MISC
American	I-MISC
,	O
I	O
must	O
recall	O
that	O
not	O
even	O
in	O
Chile	I-LOC
during	O
the	O
dictatorship	O
of	O
General	O
Pinochet	I-PER
,	O
or	O
in	O
Argentina	I-LOC
during	O
the	O
dictatorship	O
of	O
General	O
Jorge	I-PER
Rafael	I-PER
Videla	I-PER
—	O
perhaps	O
the	O
two	O
cruelest	O
dictatorships	O
in	O
Latin	I-LOC
America	I-LOC
—	O
was	O
there	O
similar	O
behaviour	O
against	O
embassies	O
that	O
were	O
actively	O
working	O
to	O
give	O
shelter	O
to	O
refugees	O
.	O

I	O
say	O
this	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
crucial	O
that	O
we	O
realize	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
design	O
and	O
forge	O
a	O
multilateral	O
strategy	O
which	O
is	O
strong	O
and	O
specific	O
to	O
return	O
democracy	O
to	O
Honduras	I-LOC
.	O

We	O
need	O
a	O
strategy	O
which	O
would	O
actually	O
allow	O
for	O
true	O
respect	O
for	O
human	O
rights	O
and	O
ensure	O
free	O
and	O
democratic	O
elections	O
—	O
which	O
can	O
take	O
place	O
only	O
with	O
full	O
respect	O
for	O
the	O
constitution	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
do	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
be	O
setting	O
a	O
harsh	O
precedent	O
in	O
a	O
region	O
where	O
,	O
for	O
decades	O
during	O
the	O
national	O
security	O
doctrine	O
,	O
suspensions	O
of	O
democracy	O
claimed	O
the	O
lives	O
of	O
thousands	O
and	O
thousands	O
of	O
Latin	I-MISC
Americans	I-MISC
,	O
led	O
to	O
the	O
exile	O
of	O
many	O
other	O
and	O
created	O
the	O
region	O
's	O
most	O
serious	O
economic	O
and	O
social	O
tragedy	O
in	O
memory	O
.	O

I	O
make	O
this	O
appeal	O
because	O
I	O
played	O
an	O
active	O
role	O
from	O
the	O
platform	O
of	O
the	O
Organization	I-ORG
of	I-ORG
American	I-ORG
States	I-ORG
,	O
and	O
also	O
accompanied	O
the	O
former	O
President	O
of	O
the	O
General	I-ORG
Assembly	I-ORG
,	O
Father	O
Miguel	I-PER
d'Escoto	I-PER
Brockmann	I-PER
,	O
to	O
El	I-LOC
Salvador	I-LOC
in	O
order	O
to	O
carry	O
out	O
a	O
task	O
which	O
would	O
safeguard	O
two	O
basic	O
values	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
our	O
region	O
has	O
managed	O
to	O
develop:	O
democracy	O
and	O
respect	O
for	O
human	O
rights	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
multilateralism	O
would	O
also	O
mean	O
understanding	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
set	O
common	O
and	O
general	O
rules	O
in	O
this	O
globalized	O
world	O
that	O
must	O
be	O
accepted	O
by	O
all	O
countries	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
case	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
faced	O
with	O
a	O
cynical	O
media	O
coup	O
which	O
was	O
carefully	O
hidden	O
or	O
minimized	O
because	O
,	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
slanted	O
against	O
the	O
advent	O
of	O
populist	O
progressive	O
Governments	O
in	O
the	O
region	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
defining	O
multilateralism	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
require	O
specific	O
actions	O
and	O
rules	O
so	O
that	O
absolutely	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
will	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
parameters	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
time	O
to	O
judge	O
conduct	O
,	O
attitudes	O
and	O
institutional	O
situations	O
.	O

Yesterday	O
I	O
took	O
part	O
in	O
the	O
climate	O
change	O
event	O
convened	O
by	O
Secretary-General	O
Ban	I-PER
Ki-moon	I-PER
in	O
order	O
to	O
bring	O
positions	O
closer	O
together	O
with	O
a	O
view	O
to	O
the	O
Copenhagen	I-LOC
Conference	I-MISC
,	O
which	O
will	O
take	O
place	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
10	O
weeks'	O
time	O
.	O

A	O
decade	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
ago	O
we	O
agreed	O
on	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
Framework	I-MISC
Convention	I-MISC
on	I-MISC
Climate	I-MISC
Change	I-MISC
,	O
dealing	O
with	O
environmental	O
protection	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
later	O
adopted	O
the	O
Kyoto	I-MISC
Protocol	I-MISC
in	O
order	O
to	O
begin	O
ensuring	O
respect	O
for	O
those	O
obligations	O
undertaken	O
by	O
nations	O
.	O

A	O
decade	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
later	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
neither	O
agreement	O
is	O
being	O
satisfactorily	O
implemented	O
.	O

Essentially	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
sometimes	O
because	O
the	O
nations	O
most	O
responsible	O
for	O
pollution	O
and	O
gas	O
emissions	O
,	O
which	O
should	O
bear	O
greater	O
responsibility	O
for	O
reducing	O
those	O
emissions	O
,	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
investments	O
both	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
countries	O
and	O
in	O
developing	O
countries	O
,	O
cannot	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
agreement	O
either	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
was	O
saying	O
yesterday	O
in	O
our	O
meeting	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
the	O
only	O
possibility	O
of	O
successfully	O
approaching	O
globalization	O
lies	O
precisely	O
in	O
the	O
setting	O
of	O
common	O
rules	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
respected	O
by	O
all	O
nations	O
,	O
developed	O
and	O
developing	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
framework	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
mention	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
the	O
Argentine	I-MISC
Republic	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
still	O
have	O
a	O
colonial	O
enclave	O
,	O
our	O
Malvinas	I-LOC
Islands	I-LOC
,	O
which	O
persists	O
without	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
addressing	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
sovereignty	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
United	I-LOC
Kingdom	I-LOC
,	O
as	O
proclaimed	O
in	O
many	O
General	I-ORG
Assembly	I-ORG
resolutions	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
recently	O
able	O
to	O
agree	O
,	O
following	O
a	O
humanitarian	O
request	O
,	O
that	O
family	O
members	O
with	O
loved	O
ones	O
buried	O
on	O
the	O
islands	O
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
travel	O
there	O
by	O
air	O
to	O
inaugurate	O
a	O
cenotaph	O
to	O
pay	O
tribute	O
to	O
those	O
who	O
fought	O
for	O
their	O
homeland	O
.	O

All	O
of	O
this	O
points	O
to	O
the	O
very	O
clear	O
need	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
multilateralism	O
not	O
only	O
as	O
a	O
type	O
of	O
rhetorical	O
statement	O
repeated	O
every	O
year	O
in	O
this	O
or	O
other	O
multilateral	O
forums	O
,	O
but	O
rather	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
concrete	O
results	O
.	O

Otherwise	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
become	O
increasingly	O
complicated	O
,	O
with	O
ever	O
more	O
unresolved	O
problems	O
.	O

For	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
final	O
analysis	O
,	O
the	O
multilateralism	O
we	O
have	O
been	O
persistently	O
proclaiming	O
since	O
2003	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
put	O
into	O
practice	O
.	O

My	O
country	O
and	O
the	O
United	I-LOC

are	O
the	O
only	O
two	O
countries	O

experienced	O

I	O
said	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
constitutional	O

that	O
the	O

I	O
know	O
that	O
some	O

speakers	O
from	O
now	O
the	O
President	O

will	O
take	O
the	O

Surely	O
,	O
he	O
will	O
once	O
again	O
deny	O
tragedies	O
that	O
occurred	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
western	O
history	O
in	O
the	O
twentieth	O

He	O
will	O
surely	O
invoke	O
the	O

of	O
other	O

And	O
he	O
will	O
also	O
surely	O
invoke	O
God	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
my	O
country	O
,	O
the	O
Argentine	I-MISC
Republic	O
,	O
is	O
not	O
an	O
imperialist	O
country	O
—	O
neither	O
by	O

as	O
a	O
reflection	O
of	O
our	O

To	O
the	O
contrary	O

ours	O
is	O
a	O
country	O
that	O
suffered	O
from	O

During	O
the	O

we	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
tell	O
him	O
that	O

like	O
him	O

I	O
believe	O
in	O
God	O

We	O
may	O
do	O
so	O
in	O
different	O

,	O
in	O
the	O
end	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O

As	O

therefore	O
,	O
I	O
humbly	O
reiterate	O
once	O

our	O
appeal	O
for	O
the	O
extradition	O
of	O
the	O
officials	O
whom	O
Argentina	I-LOC

justice	O

believes	O

not	O

all	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
wish	O
to	O
conclude	O
without	O
referring	O
to	O
three	O
events	O
that	O
I	O
believe	O
are	O
very	O
positive	O

which	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
share	O
with	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O

The	O
first	O

Thirty	O
years	O
later	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
who	O
comprised	O
the	O
Commission	O

the	O
men	O

women	O
who	O
are	O
its	O

by	O

We	O
have	O
also	O
reached	O
an	O
agreement	O
with	O
the	O
Inter-American	I-ORG
Court	I-ORG
to	O
send	O
a	O
bill	O
to	O
our	O
legislature	O
—	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
done	O
—	O
to	O
eliminate	O
the	O
crime	O
of	O
libel	O
and	O
defamation	O
against	O
journalists	O

That	O
is	O
homage	O
to	O
the	O
freedom	O
of	O
expression	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
press	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
also	O
firmly	O
believe	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
apply	O
to	O
all	O
citizens	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
offensive	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
twenty-first	O
century	O
,	O
someone	O
could	O
be	O
sentenced	O
to	O
prison	O
for	O
having	O
said	O
something	O
and	O
said	O
it	O
freely	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
also	O
reached	O
an	O
agreement	O
to	O
send	O
up	O
two	O
bills	O
—	O
which	O
we	O
have	O
also	O
already	O
done	O
—	O
to	O
contribute	O
to	O
the	O
recovery	O
of	O
children	O
born	O
in	O
captivity	O
during	O
the	O
dictatorship	O
.	O

Those	O
will	O
include	O
provisions	O
to	O
ensure	O
respect	O
for	O
the	O
victims	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
on	O

The	O
second	O
thing	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
share	O
has	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
I	O
listened	O
today	O
to	O
the	O
President	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
States	I-LOC
speak	O
about	O
an	O
issue	O
that	O
is	O
crucial	O
to	O
world	O
peace	O
and	O
security	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
Palestinian	I-MISC
people	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
a	O
key	O
component	O
of	O
a	O
strategy	O
against	O
international	O
terrorism	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
ever	O
,	O
we	O
continue	O
to	O
condemn	O

It	O
is	O
genuinely	O
satisfying	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
salve	O
to	O
the	O
soul	O
,	O
to	O
hear	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
President	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-LOC
States	I-LOC
of	I-LOC
America	I-LOC
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
need	O
for	O
the	O
Palestinian	I-MISC

to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
live	O
on	O

a	O

The	O
words	O
of	O
the	O
President	O
and	O
the	O
timely	O
message	O
he	O
delivered	O
at	O
Cairo	I-MISC
University	I-MISC
,	O
which	O
many	O
here	O
likely	O
followed	O
with	O
interest	O
,	O
place	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
not	O
occupied	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
beginning	O
negotiations	O
—	O
successful	O
ones	O
,	O
I	O
hope	O
—	O
between	O
the	O
Palestinian	I-MISC

and	O
the	O
Government	O
of	O
Israel	I-LOC
to	O
at	O

Lastly	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
tell	O
the	O
Assembly	I-ORG
that	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
Group	I-ORG
of	I-ORG
20	I-ORG
(	O
G-20	I-ORG
)	O
,	O
which	O
will	O
meet	O
tomorrow	O
in	O
Pittsburgh	I-LOC
,	O
we	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
call	O
for	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
another	O
multilateral	O
body	O
to	O
be	O
heard	O
from	O
at	O
those	O
meetings:	O
the	O
International	I-ORG
Labour	I-ORG
Organization	I-ORG
.	O

In	O
the	O
two	O
previous	O
G-20	I-ORG
meetings	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
discussion	O
about	O
the	O
financial	O
crisis	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
then	O
,	O
we	O
continue	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
a	O
key	O
issue	O
is	O
to	O
once	O
again	O
discuss	O
the	O
real	O
economy	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
we	O
believed	O
it	O
timely	O
that	O
workers	O
and	O
business	O
owners	O
,	O
as	O
genuine	O
actors	O
in	O
the	O
real	O
economy	O
and	O
as	O
catalysts	O
to	O
re-energizing	O
it	O
,	O
should	O
be	O
heard	O
from	O
as	O
well	O
in	O
those	O
forums	O
,	O
alongside	O
officials	O
from	O
multilateral	O
credit	O
institutions	O
and	O
the	O
World	I-ORG
Bank	I-ORG
.	O

We	O
are	O
genuinely	O
convinced	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
need	O
to	O
build	O
a	O
new	O
multilateralism	O
in	O
which	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
are	O
genuinely	O
on	O
an	O
equal	O
footing	O
;	O
where	O
rights	O
and	O
obligations	O
and	O
the	O
road	O
map	O
for	O
the	O
course	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
are	O
the	O
same	O
for	O
rich	O
and	O
poor	O
countries	O
alike	O
;	O
and	O
where	O
the	O
rights	O
and	O
responsibilities	O
of	O
developing	O
countries	O
are	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
those	O
of	O
developed	O
States	O
.	O

We	O
therefore	O
agreed	O
that	O
equal	O
rules	O
of	O
the	O
game	O
for	O
the	O
entire	O
world	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
basic	O
elements	O
of	O
ensuring	O
success	O
in	O
building	O
multilateralism	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
achieve	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
continue	O
with	O
these	O
rhetorical	O
exercises	O
year	O
after	O
year	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
will	O
never	O
achieve	O
the	O
results	O
that	O
are	O
not	O
a	O
right	O
but	O
an	O
obligation	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
who	O
make	O
up	O
this	O
body	O
.	O

In	O
conclusion	O
,	O
democracy	O
,	O
the	O
defence	O
of	O
human	O
rights	O
,	O
and	O
equal	O
rules	O
for	O
all	O
countries	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
are	O
the	O
three	O
key	O
elements	O
to	O
building	O
a	O
new	O
multilateralism	O
.	O

These	O
three	O
requirements	O
must	O
be	O
equal	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
for	O
all	O
countries	O
,	O
but	O
above	O
all	O
for	O
those	O
that	O
,	O
through	O
their	O
own	O
actions	O
and	O
because	O
of	O
their	O
level	O
of	O
social	O
and	O
economic	O
development	O
,	O
lead	O
the	O
major	O
developed	O
countries	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
the	O
greatest	O
responsibility	O
and	O
hold	O
the	O
greatest	O
leadership	O
roles	O
—	O
won	O
through	O
military	O
,	O
technological	O
,	O
economic	O
and	O
even	O
cultural	O
power	O
—	O
also	O
have	O
an	O
obligation	O
to	O
exercise	O
that	O
leadership	O
in	O
a	O
responsible	O
manner	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
,	O
the	O
developing	O
and	O
emerging	O
countries	O
,	O
feel	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
we	O
ask	O
of	O
the	O
major	O
nations	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

They	O
have	O
the	O
responsibility	O
to	O
build	O
this	O
world	O
.	O

This	O
will	O
no	O
doubt	O
be	O
echoed	O
in	O
all	O
our	O
speeches	O
,	O
but	O
this	O
building	O
must	O
be	O
done	O
every	O
day	O
through	O
our	O
decisions	O
and	O
concrete	O
actions	O
