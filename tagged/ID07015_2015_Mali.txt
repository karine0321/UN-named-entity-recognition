what	O
the	O

Without	O

were	O

specifically	O

I	O
would	O
also	O
like	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
Mali	I-LOC
hope	O
to	O
be	O
supported	O
in	O
this	O
implementation	O
phase	O
of	O
the	O
Agreement	O

Implementing	O
a	O

is	O
a	O
delicate	O

it	O
needs	O
support	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
we	O
have	O
scheduled	O
a	O
conference	O
in	O
Paris	I-LOC
on	O
22	O
October	O
to	O
raise	O
funds	O
for	O
the	O

of	O
Mali	I-LOC

God	O

we	O
will	O
hold	O
the	O

many	O

our	O

For	O
its	O
part	O

I	O
should	O
stress	O
that	O
the	O

has	O
warmly	O
welcomed	O
that	O
approach	O

However	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
worth	O
pointing	O
out	O
that	O
signing	O
the	O
Agreement	O
is	O
not	O
an	O
end	O
in	O
itself	O
but	O
requires	O
that	O
we	O
pool	O
all	O
of	O
our	O

it	O

and	O
that	O
is	O

that	O
we	O
can	O
rise	O

,	O
God	O
willing	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
I	O
repeat	O
my	O

to	O
come	O

the	O
conference	O
in	O
Paris	I-LOC
