for	O

a	O

reality	O

I	O
am	O
hopeful	O
for	O
the	O
future	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
United	I-ORG

,	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
useful	O
experience	O
to	O
tackle	O
today	O
's	O
challenges	O
,	O
and	O
because	O
a	O

is	O
rising	O

The	O

At	O
this	O

more	O

we	O

The	O

Many	O
military	O
conflicts	O
today	O
are	O
not	O
tied	O
to	O
defending	O
a	O

but	O
are	O
motivated	O
by	O
borderless	O

goals	O

Paradoxically	O
,	O
although	O
we	O
are	O
more	O
aware	O
of	O
those	O
challenges	O
and	O
understand	O
them	O
better	O
than	O
ever	O
,	O
we	O
seem	O
unable	O
to	O
tackle	O
them	O
decisively	O

effectively	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
we	O
have	O
gathered	O

and	O
embarked	O
on	O
a	O
momentous	O
new	O
journey	O
to	O
do	O
much	O
better	O
to	O
transform	O
our	O
world	O

The	O
only	O
way	O
to	O
bring	O
peace	O
and	O
stability	O
is	O
through	O
a	O
system	O
of	O
rules	O
and	O
norms	O
,	O
laws	O
and	O
institutions	O
that	O
every	O
country	O
agrees	O
to	O
abide	O
by	O
in	O
exchange	O
for	O
the	O
benefits	O
of	O
peace	O
and	O
stability	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
fails	O
to	O
adopt	O
a	O
system	O
of	O
laws	O
,	O
we	O
all	O
will	O
fail	O
.	O

The	O
future	O
is	O
not	O
only	O
about	O
the	O

The	O

Therefore	O

we	O
have	O
no	O
