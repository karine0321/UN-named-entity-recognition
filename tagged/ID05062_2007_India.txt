It	O
is	O
high	O

bring	O
these	O
ideas	O
to	O
implementation	O

Reform	O

would	O
also	O
be	O
incomplete	O
without	O
revitalization	O
of	O
the	O

The	O
central	O

be	O
the	O
restoration	O

of	O

it	O

through	O
an	O
intergovernmental	O

The	O
litmus	O
test	O
for	O
any	O
reform	O

is	O
whether	O
it	O

the	O

India	I-LOC
would	O
therefore	O
judge	O
reform	O

by	O
their	O
impact	O

the	O

the	O

India	I-LOC
's	O
long-standing	O
commitment	O
to	O
universal	O
,	O
non-discriminatory	O
and	O
comprehensive	O
nuclear	O
disarmament	O
is	O
embodied	O
in	O
the	O
vision	O
of	O
late	O
Prime	O
Minister	O
Rajiv	O
Gandhi	O
for	O
a	O
nuclear-free	O
and	O
non-violent	O
world	O

This	O
vision	O
was	O
put	O
forward	O
nearly	O
two	O
decades	O
ago	O
.	O

It	O
remains	O
undiminished	O
today	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
all	O
the	O
more	O
relevant	O
today	O
,	O
given	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
peaceful	O
uses	O
of	O
nuclear	O
energy	O
can	O
address	O
the	O
inexorably	O
growing	O

We	O
will	O
be	O
bringing	O
proposals	O
to	O
Member	O
States	O
and	O
this	O
Organization	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
we	O
can	O
refocus	O
on	O
general	O
and	O
complete	O
disarmament	O
,	O
particularly	O
nuclear	O
disarmament	O

Disarmament	O
is	O
our	O
agreed	O
goal	O

and	O
it	O
subsumes	O
arms	O
control	O
and	O
non-proliferation	O

It	O
is	O
well	O
known	O
that	O
India	I-LOC
has	O
an	O
impeccable	O
record	O
in	O
preventing	O
the	O
proliferation	O
of	O

technologies	O

is	O
in	O
keeping	O
with	O
our	O
commitment	O
to	O

a	O
responsible	O
nuclear	O
Power	O

India	I-LOC
is	O
ready	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
to	O
develop	O
a	O
new	O
international	O
consensus	O
on	O
non-proliferation	O

The	O
international	O
community	O
needs	O
to	O
intensify	O
the	O
effort	O
to	O
address	O
the	O
very	O
real	O
threat	O
posed	O
by	O
the	O
link	O
between	O
the	O
proliferation	O
of	O
weapons	O
of	O
mass	O
destruction	O
(WMDs)	O
and	O
related	O

and	O
technologies	O
and	O
the	O
ability	O
of	O
non-State	O
actors	O
to	O
acquire	O
them	O

The	O
risk	O
posed	O
by	O
the	O
intersection	O
between	O
proliferation	O
and	O
terrorism	O
is	O
real	O
and	O
serious	O
.	O

The	O
central	O
objective	O
must	O
be	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
our	O
solidarity	O
in	O
words	O
is	O
translated	O
into	O
action	O

The	O
adoption	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
Global	I-MISC
Counter-Terrorism	I-MISC
Strategy	I-MISC
last	O
September	O
was	O
a	O
noteworthy	O
development	O
,	O
signalling	O
the	O
will	O
of	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
to	O
combat	O
this	O
menace	O
in	O
a	O
holistic	O
and	O
coordinated	O
manner	O

Welcome	O
as	O
the	O
Strategy	O
is	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
much	O
more	O
that	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
to	O
combat	O
the	O
menace	O
that	O
international	O
terrorism	O
has	O
become	O
.	O

India	I-LOC
is	O
convinced	O
that	O
without	O
the	O
early	O
adoption	O
of	O
a	O
comprehensive	O
convention	O
against	O
international	O
terrorism	O
,	O
the	O
global	O
struggle	O
against	O
terrorism	O
remains	O
incomplete	O
and	O
likely	O
to	O
succeed	O
only	O
partially	O
.	O

We	O
must	O
ensure	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
zero	O
tolerance	O
for	O
all	O
forms	O
of	O
terrorism	O
.	O

In	O
conclusion	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
express	O
the	O
hope	O
that	O
our	O
deliberations	O
in	O
the	O

ahead	O
will	O
lead	O
us	O
to	O
enlightened	O

With	O
