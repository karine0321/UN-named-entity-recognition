global	O
economic	O

and	O
continuing	O

and	O
inclusive	O

are	O
naturally	O
important	O

That	O
priority	O
should	O
anchor	O
the	O
post-2015	O

which	O

be	O

But	O
we	O
will	O
fall	O
short	O
of	O
realizing	O
an	O
ambitious	O
post-2015	O

if	O
we	O
focus	O
merely	O
on	O
governance	O
issues	O
at	O
the	O

of	O

This	O
agenda	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
merely	O
about	O
reprioritizing	O

also	O
about	O
fostering	O
