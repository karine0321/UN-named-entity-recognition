Today	O
's	O
world	O
is	O
faced	O
with	O
both	O
challenges	O
and	O
tasks	O
.	O

We	O
are	O
witnessing	O
a	O
plethora	O
of	O
serious	O
international	O
crises	O
in	O
various	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
crises	O
that	O
have	O
impacted	O
international	O
peace	O
and	O
security	O
,	O
most	O
notably	O
in	O
the	O
Middle	I-LOC
East	I-LOC

but	O
also	O
in	O
Europe	I-LOC
and	O
Africa	I-LOC

Those	O
crises	O
affect	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
huge	O
segments	O
of	O
the	O
civilian	O
populations	O
,	O
who	O

in	O
desperation	O

are	O
fleeing	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
save	O
their	O
lives	O
and	O
forge	O
a	O
better	O
future	O

As	O
an	O
international	O
community	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
dutybound	O
to	O
react	O
with	O
solidarity	O
to	O
restore	O
peace	O
and	O
deploy	O
a	O
response	O
that	O
will	O
enable	O
us	O
to	O
minimize	O
the	O
suffering	O
of	O
both	O
the	O
victims	O
of	O
war	O
and	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
fleeing	O
from	O
war	O
.	O

We	O
commend	O
the	O
efforts	O
that	O
many	O
countries	O
are	O
making	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
the	O
refugees	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
must	O
do	O
more	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
my	O
Government	O
has	O
decided	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
refugees	O
from	O
the	O
civil	O
war	O
in	O
Syria	I-LOC
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
also	O
why	O
Chile	I-LOC
will	O
expand	O
cooperation	O
with	O
Africa	I-LOC
.	O

As	O
of	O
2016	O
,	O
for	O

,	O
we	O
will	O
be	O
participating	O
in	O
United	I-ORG

operations	O
in	O
that	O
region	O

In	O
addition	O
to	O
facint	O
the	O
most	O
urgent	O
challenges	O
threatening	O
peace	O
,	O
our	O
planet	O
has	O
yet	O
to	O
stem	O
growing	O
inequality	O
or	O
reach	O
an	O
agreement	O
that	O
would	O
halt	O

It	O
is	O
for	O
that	O
reason	O

against	O
the	O

of	O
such	O
serious	O
international	O
challenges	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
seventieth	O
session	O
of	O
the	O
General	I-ORG

will	O
go	O
down	O
in	O
history	O
as	O
a	O
momentous	O
occasion	O
on	O
which	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
succeeded	O
in	O
forging	O
an	O
agreement	O

namely	O

the	O
2030	O
Agenda	I-MISC
for	I-MISC
Sustainable	I-MISC

(resolution	O
70/1)	O

That	O
Agenda	O
is	O
replete	O
with	O
hope	O
and	O
is	O
binding	O
in	O
nature	O
.	O

It	O
focuses	O
on	O
addressing	O
various	O
aspects	O
of	O
inequality	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
main	O
challenge	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
Latin	I-LOC
America	I-LOC

and	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
it	O
goes	O
without	O

in	O
Chile	I-LOC
as	O
well	O

In	O
this	O
new	O
phase	O
of	O
our	O
economic	O
and	O
political	O
development	O
the	O
new	O
Agenda	O
is	O
broad	O
and	O
ambitious	O
and	O
is	O
commensurate	O
with	O
the	O
pressing	O
challenges	O
and	O
long-term	O
goals	O
of	O
fair	O
,	O
creative	O
and	O
peaceful	O
human	O
coexistence	O

It	O
does	O
not	O
sweep	O
aside	O
the	O
commitments	O
that	O
have	O
already	O
been	O
entered	O
into	O
whose	O
fulfilment	O
is	O

rather	O
incorporates	O

integrating	O
them	O
multidimensionally	O
into	O
the	O
concept	O
of	O
sustainable	O
and	O

It	O
is	O
,	O
in	O
other	O
words	O

an	O
Agenda	O
of	O

That	O
is	O
an	O

a	O

They	O
are	O
the	O

indeed	O
the	O
foundation	O
of	O
a	O
mode	O
of	O
coexistence	O
based	O
on	O
very	O
deeply	O

values	O

We	O
have	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
address	O
the	O
feelings	O
of	O
despair	O
and	O
hopelessness	O
about	O
the	O
future	O
and	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
trust	O
in	O
institutions	O
that	O
permeate	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
societies	O
.	O

The	O
chief	O
responsibility	O
for	O
sustainable	O
and	O
more	O
equal	O
development	O
rests	O
with	O
each	O
individual	O
country	O

Chile	I-LOC
is	O
wholeheartedly	O
committed	O
to	O
delivering	O
on	O
that	O
responsibility	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
success	O
in	O
that	O
endeavour	O
requires	O
a	O
propitious	O
environment	O
,	O
since	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
targets	O
are	O
affected	O
by	O
global	O
dynamics	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
challenges	O
that	O
we	O
face	O
today	O
cannot	O
be	O
resolved	O
by	O
any	O
single	O
country	O
acting	O
in	O
isolation	O
.	O

Only	O
if	O
we	O
can	O
deliver	O
on	O
an	O
agenda	O
of	O
change	O
at	O
the	O
global	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
national	O
levels	O
will	O
it	O
be	O
possible	O
to	O
promote	O
more	O
inclusive	O
and	O
sustainable	O
societies	O

When	O
international	O
trade	O
does	O
not	O
act	O
as	O
an	O
engine	O
of	O
growth	O
,	O
when	O
financial	O
flows	O
are	O
asymmetrical	O
,	O
minimal	O
and	O
volatile	O
,	O
if	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
fair	O
and	O
effective	O
mechanisms	O
for	O

with	O

if	O
there	O
are	O
not	O
enough	O
predictable	O
flows	O

,	O
then	O
emerging	O
countries	O

especially	O
the	O

will	O
have	O
great	O
difficulty	O
in	O
attaining	O
the	O
Goals	I-MISC
contained	O
in	O
the	O
2030	O
Agenda	O
.	O

Similarly	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
international	O
financial	O
,	O
monetary	O
and	O
trading	O
systems	O
must	O
operate	O
more	O
democratically	O
,	O
effectively	O

fairly	O
in	O

That	O
is	O
not	O
always	O
the	O
case	O
at	O

Consequently	O
,	O
a	O
basic	O
prerequisite	O
for	O
making	O
the	O

a	O
reality	O
is	O
to	O
strengthen	O
the	O

with	O
broad	O
representation	O
,	O
clear	O

We	O
are	O
calling	O
for	O
an	O
architecture	O
of	O
multilateral	O
institutions	O
that	O
will	O
provide	O
backing	O
for	O
the	O
national	O
policies	O
proposed	O
under	O
the	O
2030	O
Agenda	O

plays	O
in	O
the	O

In	O
2014	O

2015	O

have	O
served	O
as	O
a	O
non-permanent	O
member	O
of	O
the	O

In	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
that	O
experience	O
we	O
wish	O
to	O
reaffirm	O
our	O
belief	O
in	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
reform	O
the	O
Council	I-ORG
by	O
increasing	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
its	O

by	O

the	O
considerable	O

progress	O
seen	O

it	O

One	O
essential	O
element	O
for	O

the	O
