I	O

wish	O

the	O

we	O
note	O

that	O
some	O

Regarding	O

we	O
express	O
our	O

with	O
the	O
Syrian	I-MISC
people	O

Peru	I-LOC
condemns	O
the	O
use	O
of	O

unacceptable	O
in	O
all	O

It	O
is	O
an	O
affront	O
to	O
humankind	O
and	O
a	O
clear	O
violation	O
of	O
international	O
law	O

The	O
Syrian	I-MISC

deserve	O
an	O
immediate	O
solution	O
to	O
the	O
bloody	O
conflict	O
ravaging	O
their	O
country	O

We	O
therefore	O
urge	O
all	O
parties	O

find	O
a	O
peaceful	O

solution	O
that	O

We	O

call	O

uphold	O
its	O

peace	O

At	O
the	O

The	O
gap	O
marginalizing	O
the	O

from	O
the	O

widens	O
by	O

the	O

enshrined	O
in	O
the	O
Charter	I-MISC
of	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
crucial	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
strengthen	O

uphold	O
our	O
global	O
commitment	O
to	O

our	O

It	O
is	O
therefore	O
particularly	O
gratifying	O
for	O
Peru	I-LOC

a	O
source	O
of	O
genuine	O

that	O

that	O

It	O
was	O

Our	O
efforts	O

at	O
the	O
creation	O

a	O
twenty-first-century	O
State	O

a	O
State	O
that	O
serves	O
all	O

We	O
cannot	O

that	O
a	O

that	O

the	O

my	O

in	O

The	O

Economic	O
growth	O
is	O
a	O
means	O

not	O
an	O
end	O

it	O

an	O

Our	O

those	O
who	O

cannot	O
wait	O
indefinitely	O
for	O

the	O

In	O

That	O

of	O
