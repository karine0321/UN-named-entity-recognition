On	O

myself	O

may	O
I	O
extend	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Jeremić	I-PER
our	O
warmest	O
congratulations	O
on	O
his	O
election	O
as	O
President	O
of	O
the	O
General	I-ORG
Assembly	I-ORG
at	O
its	O
sixty-seventh	O
session	O
.	O

His	O
extensive	O
experience	O
in	O
both	O
regional	O
and	O
international	O
affairs	O
will	O
undoubtedly	O
enrich	O
the	O
debate	O
and	O
the	O
proceedings	O
during	O
this	O
session	O

I	O
wish	O
to	O
assure	O
him	O
of	O
the	O
full	O
cooperation	O
of	O
Zimbabwe	I-LOC
as	O
he	O
discharges	O
the	O
onerous	O
duties	O
of	O
that	O
high	O
office	O

If	O
I	O
may	O
be	O
allowed	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
preface	O
my	O
speech	O
with	O
a	O
reference	O
to	O
the	O
most	O
glowing	O
and	O
moving	O
speech	O
that	O
we	O
heard	O
from	O
the	O
President	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
States	I-LOC
yesterday	O
(	O
see	O
A/67/PV.6	0
)	O
,	O
the	O
significance	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
us	O
to	O
condemn	O
the	O
tragic	O
death	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
States	I-LOC
Ambassador	O
to	O
Libya	I-LOC
.	O

I	O
am	O
sure	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
moved	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
all	O
agree	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
an	O
appalling	O
event	O
that	O
we	O
all	O
condemn	O
.	O

A	O
year	O
ago	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
barbaric	O
and	O
brutal	O
death	O
of	O
the	O
Head	O
of	O
State	O
of	O
Libya	I-LOC
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
African	I-ORG
Union	I-ORG
.	O

His	O
death	O
occurred	O
in	O
a	O
context	O
in	O
which	O
NATO	I-ORG
was	O
operating	O
supposedly	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
protect	O
civilians	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
join	O
the	O
United	I-LOC
States	I-LOC
in	O
spirit	O
in	O
condemning	O
the	O
Ambassador	O
's	O
death	O
,	O
will	O
the	O
United	I-LOC
States	I-LOC
also	O
join	O
us	O
in	O
condemning	O
the	O
barbaric	O
death	O
of	O
the	O
Head	O
of	O
State	O
of	O
Libya	I-LOC
,	O
Al-Qadhafi	I-PER
?	O

That	O
great	O
and	O
tragic	O
loss	O
to	O
Africa	I-LOC
occurred	O
in	O
circumstances	O
in	O
which	O
NATO	I-ORG
had	O
sought	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
Security	I-ORG
Council	I-ORG
under	O
Chapter	I-MISC
VII	I-MISC
to	O
operate	O
in	O
Libya	I-LOC
in	O
the	O
protection	O
of	O
civilians	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
the	O
mercy	O
of	O
the	O
Government	O
of	O
Libya	I-LOC
,	O
led	O
by	O
Colonel	O
Al-Qadhafi	I-PER
.	O

The	O
mission	O
was	O
strictly	O
to	O
protect	O
civilians	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
became	O
a	O
brutal	O
hunt	O
for	O
Al-Qadhafi	I-PER
and	O
his	O
family	O
.	O

NATO	I-ORG
caught	O
up	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

Al-Qadhafi	I-PER
and	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
children	O
suffered	O
the	O
brutal	O
deaths	O
about	O
which	O
we	O
know	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
United	I-LOC
States	I-LOC
President	O
spoke	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
that	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
aware	O
that	O
his	O
country	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
NATO	I-ORG
Power	O
,	O
had	O
,	O
alongside	O
the	O
other	O
NATO	I-ORG
Powers	O
,	O
the	O
authority	O
under	O
Chapter	I-MISC
VII	I-MISC
to	O
operate	O
in	O
Libya	I-LOC
in	O
order	O
to	O
protect	O
civilians	O
.	O

But	O
is	O
that	O
what	O
the	O
operation	O
turned	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
?	O

In	O
a	O
very	O
dishonest	O
manner	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
authority	O
entrusted	O
under	O
Chapter	I-MISC
VII	I-MISC
being	O
used	O
as	O
a	O
weapon	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
rout	O
a	O
whole	O
family	O
and	O
to	O
commit	O
the	O
murders	O
that	O
occurred	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
.	O

Bombs	O
were	O
hurled	O
in	O
a	O
callous	O
manner	O
.	O

Quite	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
civilians	O
died	O
.	O

Was	O
that	O
the	O
protection	O
they	O
had	O
sought	O
under	O
Chapter	I-MISC
VII	I-MISC
of	O
the	O
Charter	O
?	O

So	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
Al-Qadhafi	I-PER
must	O
be	O
seen	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
tragic	O
vein	O
as	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
Chris	I-PER
Stevens	I-PER
.	O

We	O
condemn	O
both	O
.	O

Let	O
me	O
begin	O
by	O
reaffirming	O
the	O
rightful	O
and	O
important	O
role	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
in	O
the	O
management	O
of	O
issues	O
affecting	O
international	O
peace	O
and	O
security	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
quest	O
for	O
a	O
more	O
just	O
and	O
equitable	O
international	O
order	O
,	O
Zimbabwe	I-LOC
remains	O
strongly	O
opposed	O
to	O
unilateralism	O
and	O
committed	O
to	O
multilateralism	O
.	O

We	O
would	O
therefore	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
that	O
continues	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
guarantor	O
of	O
world	O
peace	O
and	O
security	O
and	O
a	O
bulwark	O
in	O
the	O
fight	O
for	O
justice	O
and	O
equality	O
among	O
nations	O
.	O

It	O
behoves	O
us	O
all	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
necessary	O
steps	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
is	O
not	O
marginalized	O
on	O
international	O
issues	O
.	O

Equally	O
important	O
,	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
must	O
,	O
in	O
future	O
,	O
never	O
allow	O
itself	O
to	O
be	O
abused	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
I	O
referred	O
to	O
earlier	O
,	O
when	O
NATO	I-ORG
sought	O
under	O
Chapter	I-MISC
VII	I-MISC
authority	O
to	O
protect	O
civilians	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
turn	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
future	O
,	O
the	O
Security	I-ORG
Council	I-ORG
must	O
never	O
allow	O
itself	O
to	O
be	O
abused	O
by	O
any	O
Member	O

or	O
group	O
of	O
States	O
that	O
seeks	O
to	O
achieve	O
parochial	O
,	O
partisan	O
goals	O

The	O
Charter	I-MISC
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
clearly	O
stipulates	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
international	O
body	O
that	O

work	O
for	O
the	O
good	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
peoples	O

big	O

We	O
recognize	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
existing	O
and	O
emerging	O
threats	O
and	O
challenges	O
that	O
continue	O
to	O
frustrate	O
our	O

But	O
the	O
increasing	O
trend	O
among	O
the	O
NATO	I-ORG
member	O

,	O
inspired	O
by	O
the	O
arrogant	O
belief	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
most	O
powerful	O
among	O

in	O
their	O
recent	O
resort	O
to	O
unilateralism	O

the	O
very	O
antithesis	O
of	O
the	O
basic	O
principles	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG

In	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
Libya	I-LOC

the	O
African	I-ORG

and	O
its	O

The	O

sought	O
dialogue	O
between	O
the	O
Libyan	I-MISC
authorities	O
and	O
the	O
so-called	O

May	O
we	O
urge	O
the	O
international	O

to	O
collectively	O
nip	O
this	O
dangerous	O

in	O
