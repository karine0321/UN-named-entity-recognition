Mindful	O

the	O

called	O

Notwithstanding	O

all	O
these	O

Mexico	I-LOC
's	O
new	O
role	O
at	O

level	O
is	O

evident	O
in	O
our	O
promotion	O
of	O
human	O

and	O
democracy	O

My	O
country	O
has	O
stated	O
its	O
conviction	O
that	O
human	O
rights	O
represent	O
absolute	O
and	O
universal	O
values	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
such	O
,	O
the	O
obligation	O
to	O
uphold	O
them	O
is	O
a	O
duty	O
shared	O
by	O
all	O
Governments	O
and	O
peoples	O
,	O
irrespective	O
of	O

Moreover	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
been	O
consistent	O
in	O
these	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
,	O
despite	O
the	O

reaction	O
that	O
it	O
has	O
generated	O
in	O
Mexico	I-LOC

the	O
strong	O
bonds	O
of	O
friendship	O
that	O
Mexican	O
society	O
has	O
always	O
enjoyed	O
with	O
several	O
nations	O
close	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
been	O
compelled	O

express	O
our	O
concern	O
about	O
the	O
human	O

situation	O
in	O
those	O
countries	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
far-reaching	O
steps	O
we	O
have	O
taken	O
to	O
demonstrate	O
our	O
commitment	O
to	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
human	O
rights	O
is	O
the	O
harmonization	O
of	O
Mexican	I-MISC
legislation	O
with	O
international	O
instruments	O
that	O
protect	O
such	O
rights	O

We	O
have	O
placed	O
particular	O
emphasis	O
on	O
the	O
protection	O

vulnerable	O
groups	O
as	O
women	O

At	O
