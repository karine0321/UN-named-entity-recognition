However	O

we	O

to	O
recognize	O
that	O

The	O
close	O
interrelationship	O
among	O

development	O
was	O
also	O
apparent	O
at	O
the	O
recent	O
Johannesburg	I-LOC
Summit	I-LOC

where	O
the	O
positions	O
that	O
President	O
Vicente	O

put	O
forward	O
on	O

of	O
Mexico	I-LOC
were	O
widely	O
supported	O

recognized	O

Mindful	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
threats	O
to	O
international	O
security	O
,	O
the	O
Mexican	O
Government	O
has	O
also	O
called	O
for	O
the	O
security	O
arrangements	O
of	O
the	O
Americas	O
to	O
be	O
updated	O

We	O
have	O
offered	O

a	O

at	O
the	O

to	O

in	O

Notwithstanding	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
all	O
these	O
actions	O
,	O
Mexico	I-LOC
's	O
new	O
role	O
at	O
the	O
international	O
level	O
is	O
particularly	O
evident	O
in	O
our	O
promotion	O
of	O
human	O
rights	O
and	O
democracy	O
.	O

My	O
country	O
has	O
stated	O
its	O
conviction	O
that	O
human	O
rights	O
represent	O
absolute	O
and	O
universal	O
values	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
such	O
,	O
the	O
obligation	O
to	O
uphold	O
them	O
is	O
a	O
duty	O
shared	O
by	O
all	O
Governments	O
and	O
peoples	O
,	O
irrespective	O
of	O
borders	O
and	O
sovereignties	O

Moreover	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
been	O
consistent	O
in	O
these	O
convictions	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
,	O
despite	O
the	O
mixed	O
reaction	O
that	O
it	O
has	O
generated	O
in	O
Mexico	I-LOC
,	O
given	O
the	O
strong	O
bonds	O
of	O
friendship	O
that	O
Mexican	O
society	O
has	O
always	O
enjoyed	O
with	O
several	O
nations	O
close	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
been	O
compelled	O
to	O
express	O
our	O
concern	O
about	O
the	O
human	O
rights	O
situation	O
in	O
those	O
countries	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
far-reaching	O
steps	O
we	O
have	O
taken	O
to	O
demonstrate	O
our	O
commitment	O
to	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
human	O
rights	O
is	O
the	O
harmonization	O
of	O
Mexican	O
legislation	O
with	O
international	O
instruments	O
that	O
protect	O
such	O
rights	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
placed	O
particular	O
emphasis	O
on	O
the	O
protection	O
of	O
such	O
vulnerable	O
groups	O
as	O
women	O
,	O
children	O
,	O
indigenous	O
peoples	O
and	O
the	O

At	O
the	O

time	O

we	O
have	O
abandoned	O
the	O

to	O
the	O

In	O

a	O
