We	O

Emboldened	O
by	O
that	O
enthusiasm	O
and	O
by	O
my	O
conviction	O
regarding	O
the	O
role	O
that	O
Japan	I-LOC
should	O
play	O
in	O
that	O
process	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
continue	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
achieve	O
reform	O
of	O
the	O
Security	I-ORG
Council	I-ORG
with	O
the	O
cooperation	O
of	O
the	O
President	O
and	O
Member	O

Japan	I-LOC
hopes	O
to	O
become	O
a	O
permanent	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
Council	I-ORG
and	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
commensurate	O
contribution	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
emphasize	O
three	O
points	O
.	O

First	O
and	O
foremost	O
,	O
Japan	I-LOC
has	O
remained	O
a	O
strictly	O
peace-loving	O
nation	O
during	O
the	O
70	O
years	O
since	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
Second	O
World	O
War	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
accumulated	O
a	O
successful	O
record	O
in	O
our	O
efforts	O
to	O
foster	O
peace	O
and	O
prosperity	O
around	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

Japan	I-LOC
worked	O
hard	O
diplomatically	O
in	O
Cambodia	I-LOC
and	O
Timor-Leste	I-LOC
,	O
first	O
by	O
sending	O
personnel	O
to	O
participate	O
in	O
peacekeeping	O
operations	O
there	O
and	O
later	O
by	O
providing	O
assistance	O
over	O
the	O
long	O
term	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
stages	O
involved	O
in	O
peacekeeping	O
operations	O
is	O
decision-making	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
determine	O
what	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
and	O
where	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
￼followed	O
by	O
the	O
necessary	O
preparations	O
of	O
personnel	O
and	O
financing	O
and	O
,	O
lastly	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
launching	O
physical	O
operations	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

Japan	I-LOC
has	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
help	O
to	O
bridge	O
the	O
information	O
gaps	O
that	O
tend	O
to	O
occur	O
between	O
those	O
stages	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
also	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
positive	O
and	O
major	O
contribution	O
by	O
ensuring	O
that	O
we	O
take	O
full	O
responsibility	O
for	O
our	O
decisions	O
and	O
actions	O
at	O
every	O
stage	O
.	O

Right	O
now	O
,	O
members	O
of	O
an	O
engineering	O
unit	O
of	O
Japan	I-LOC
's	O
self-defence	O
forces	O
are	O
working	O
around	O
the	O
clock	O
in	O
South	I-LOC
Sudan	I-LOC
.	O

In	O
Kenya	I-LOC
,	O
experts	O
from	O
our	O
ground	O
self-defence	O
force	O
are	O
training	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
Kenyan	I-MISC
,	O
Ugandan	I-MISC
,	O
Tanzanian	I-MISC
and	O
Rwandan	I-MISC
armed	O
forces	O
on	O
the	O
best	O
ways	O
to	O
operate	O
heavy	O
engineering	O
equipment	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
the	O
problems	O
that	O
arise	O
when	O
peacekeeping	O
operations	O
become	O
hopelessly	O
trapped	O
in	O
areas	O
where	O
roads	O
and	O
bridges	O
have	O
been	O
destroyed	O
.	O

We	O
also	O
recently	O
made	O
changes	O
to	O
our	O
domestic	O
legal	O
framework	O
that	O
will	O
enable	O
us	O
to	O
contribute	O
more	O
broadly	O
to	O
peacekeeping	O
operations	O
going	O
forward	O
.	O

Secondly	O
,	O
Japan	I-LOC
is	O
a	O
country	O
that	O
values	O
ownership	O
and	O
partnership	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
been	O
of	O
the	O
view	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
are	O
to	O
overcome	O
despair	O
and	O
improve	O
our	O
welfare	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
important	O
to	O
give	O
equal	O
consideration	O
both	O
to	O
the	O
wishes	O
and	O
intentions	O
of	O
the	O
parties	O
concerned	O
and	O
to	O
international	O
cooperation	O
.	O

Our	O
ultimate	O
objective	O
is	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
themselves	O
gain	O
the	O
ownership	O
that	O
will	O
enable	O
them	O
to	O
determine	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
lives	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
emphasizing	O
that	O
approach	O
to	O
arrive	O
at	O
the	O
concept	O
of	O
valuing	O
human	O
security	O
.	O

My	O
third	O
point	O
is	O
that	O
Japan	I-LOC
always	O
strives	O
to	O
listen	O
actively	O
to	O
the	O
voices	O
of	O
the	O
parties	O
concerned	O
.	O

Three	O
days	O

the	O
first	O
time	O

will	O
convene	O

where	O
I	O
hope	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
listen	O
to	O
an	O
even	O
richer	O
spectrum	O
of	O

night	O
I	O
also	O
met	O

matters	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
conducting	O
training	O
and	O
capacity-	O
building	O
related	O
to	O
tsunamis	O

Japan	I-LOC

a	O
non-permanent	O
member	O

for	O
the	O
first	O

If	O

to	O
the	O
gracious	O

of	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
our	O
eleventh	O

More	O
than	O
any	O

subjected	O
itself	O
to	O

by	O
