I	O
would	O
be	O
remiss	O
if	O
I	O
did	O

pay	O

the	O

for	O
its	O
role	O
in	O
ensuring	O
the	O
smooth	O

We	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O

for	O
some	O

continue	O

adoption	O

We	O
believe	O
that	O

between	O

We	O
note	O
with	O

that	O
some	O

this	O
a	O
negation	O
of	O

the	O

demonstrated	O
beyond	O

to	O
commit	O
themselves	O
more	O
meaningfully	O

hide	O
behind	O
hackneyed	O

all	O

oppose	O

Zimbabwe	I-LOC
has	O
made	O
tremendous	O
progress	O
in	O
the	O
provision	O
of	O

facilities	O
to	O
improve	O
the	O
quality	O

Regrettably	O
,	O
these	O
gains	O
were	O
later	O
to	O
be	O
reversed	O

as	O
the	O
Bretton	O

Zimbabwe	I-LOC
and	O
other	O
countries	O

Southern	O

are	O
grappling	O
with	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
the	O
HIV/AIDS	O

Our	O
own	O
efforts	O
at	O
combating	O
the	O
scourge	O
are	O
not	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
augmented	O
by	O
the	O
positive	O
contribution	O
of	O
those	O
countries	O
that	O
have	O
the	O
requisite	O
financial	O
resources	O
and	O

know-how	O

We	O
continue	O
to	O
call	O
on	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
and	O
private	O
companies	O
to	O
hasten	O
their	O
efforts	O
at	O
finding	O
an	O

to	O
this	O

is	O
ravaging	O

those	O
who	O

from	O

the	O

by	O

We	O

that	O
the	O

at	O
last	O

's	O
General	I-ORG

special	O
session	O

HIV/AIDS	O
will	O
receive	O
the	O
urgent	O
and	O
meaningful	O
support	O
that	O
it	O
deserves	O
.	O

As	O
you	O
are	O
aware	O
,	O
my	O
country	O
and	O
most	O
parts	O
of	O
Southern	O
Africa	O
,	O
are	O
currently	O
experiencing	O
a	O
humanitarian	O
crisis	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
the	O
drought	O
that	O
hit	O
during	O
the	O
main	O
cereal-producing	O
season	O
earlier	O
this	O

We	O
commend	O
the	O
efforts	O
being	O
made	O
by	O
international	O
organizations	O
and	O
the	O
donor	O
community	O
to	O
provide	O
urgent	O
food	O
and	O
non-food	O
aid	O
to	O
our	O

We	O
particularly	O
wish	O
to	O
mention	O
the	O
efforts	O
of	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
agencies	O
in	O
this	O

We	O
also	O
welcome	O
additional	O
assistance	O
in	O
programmes	O
that	O
will	O
mitigate	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
future	O

Finally	O
,	O
my	O
delegation	O
is	O
happy	O
to	O
inform	O
you	O
that	O
Zimbabwe	I-LOC
has	O
concluded	O
the	O
fast-track	O
land-redistribution	O
programme	O
that	O
we	O
introduced	O
in	O
July	O
2000	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
transfer	O
land	O
to	O
the	O
hitherto	O
landless	O
black	O
majority	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
be	O
recalled	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
face	O
vehement	O
protestations	O
,	O
bad	O
publicity	O
and	O
misinformation	O
from	O
those	O
who	O
did	O
not	O
wish	O
us	O
well	O
.	O

We	O
remained	O
resolute	O
in	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
powerful	O
forces	O
determined	O
to	O
preserve	O
vestiges	O
of	O
colonial	O
privilege	O
.	O

The	O
primary	O
objective	O
of	O
our	O
agrarian	O
reforms	O
has	O
been	O
to	O
redress	O
the	O
colonial	O
injustice	O
perpetrated	O
by	O
Britain	I-LOC
,	O
whereby	O
a	O
minority	O
of	O
British	O
settlers	O
in	O
1890	O
seized	O
our	O
land	O
and	O
acquired	O
our	O
natural	O
resources	O
but	O
never	O
paid	O
any	O
compensation	O
to	O
our	O
ancestors	O
.	O

By	O
assuming	O
its	O
independence	O
in	O
1980	O
,	O
Zimbabwe	I-LOC
discarded	O
the	O
colonial	O
yoke	O
for	O
all	O
time	O
and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
will	O
never	O
brook	O
any	O
interference	O
in	O
its	O
domestic	O
affairs	O
by	O
any	O
foreign	O
Power	O

and	O
especially	O
to	O
its	O
current	O
Prime	O

Mr.	O
Tony	O

that	O
Zimbabwe	I-LOC

stand	O

We	O
want	O
to	O

to	O
carry	O
out	O
our	O
just	O
reforms	O
