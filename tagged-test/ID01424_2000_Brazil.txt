our	O

We	O
meet	O
here	O
for	O
the	O

We	O
all	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
twentieth	O

has	O
been	O
marred	O
by	O
a	O
fundamental	O
contradiction	O

We	O
have	O
seen	O
a	O
growing	O
abundance	O
of	O
intellectual	O
and	O
material	O
resources	O
that	O
should	O
have	O
brought	O
about	O
a	O
greater	O
convergence	O

opportunities	O

expectations	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
of	O
living	O
standards	O
throughout	O
the	O
world	O

Yet	O
,	O
what	O
we	O
also	O
saw	O
was	O
a	O
failure	O
to	O
harness	O
the	O
necessary	O
political	O
will	O
to	O
translate	O
those	O
extraordinary	O
possibilities	O
into	O
a	O
reality	O
of	O
progress	O
shared	O

This	O
applies	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
as	O
a	O
whole	O
but	O
is	O
equally	O
valid	O
for	O

of	O

No	O

we	O
have	O
much	O
to	O
gain	O
in	O

that	O
are	O
a	O

Yet	O
it	O
is	O
equally	O
illuminating	O
to	O
seek	O
within	O
our	O
own	O
countries	O
examples	O
of	O
success	O
and	O
failure	O
that	O
help	O
explain	O
the	O

live	O
in	O

Globalization	O
is	O
asymmetrical	O
in	O
part	O
because	O
it	O
flows	O
from	O
national	O
societies	O
that	O
are	O
themselves	O
socially	O
unbalanced	O

seem	O
to	O

That	O
is	O
a	O

There	O
is	O

that	O
the	O

of	O

are	O
dangerously	O

put	O
aside	O

It	O
is	O

that	O
these	O
two	O

essential	O
elements	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
our	O

They	O
must	O
retake	O
their	O
rightful	O
place	O
at	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
our	O
policy	O
decisions	O
before	O
it	O
is	O
too	O
late	O
—	O
before	O
some	O
are	O
misled	O
into	O
believing	O
that	O
the	O
inevitable	O
price	O
for	O
preserving	O
freedom	O
is	O
the	O
perpetuation	O
of	O
the	O
divide	O
between	O
the	O

If	O

are	O
to	O
put	O
down	O
firm	O

within	O
our	O
countries	O

we	O
must	O
foster	O
a	O
genuine	O
sense	O
of	O
solidarity	O
that	O
translates	O
into	O
effective	O
action	O

Only	O
thus	O
will	O
we	O
build	O
an	O
international	O
order	O
that	O
is	O
conducive	O
to	O
the	O
preservation	O
of	O

and	O
can	O
function	O
as	O
an	O
engine	O
of	O
sustained	O

It	O
is	O
unacceptable	O
that	O
major	O
global	O
issues	O

campaigns	O
for	O

be	O
manipulated	O

exploited	O
in	O

to	O
disguise	O
what	O
amounts	O
to	O
the	O
protection	O
of	O

this	O
is	O
what	O

in	O

of	O

First	O

the	O

As	O
I	O

,	O
the	O

discrimination	O

And	O
discrimination	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
waged	O
against	O
the	O

is	O
the	O
absolute	O
negation	O

distortions	O
in	O

It	O

whose	O
economies	O

strongly	O
based	O
in	O
the	O

should	O
be	O
legally	O
entitled	O
to	O
restrict	O
access	O

goods	O

while	O
they	O
call	O
for	O
the	O

of	O
those	O
goods	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
benefit	O
from	O
an	O
enormous	O

advantage	O

It	O
is	O
even	O
more	O
intolerable	O
that	O
these	O
countries	O
be	O
allowed	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
presently	O
the	O
case	O

to	O

the	O
tune	O
of	O

nations	O
that	O
are	O
more	O
efficient	O

the	O
persistence	O
of	O
this	O
highly	O

situation	O

This	O
is	O

the	O
new	O
language	O
of	O
protectionism	O

camouflaged	O
as	O
humanitarian	O
internationalism	O

would	O

of	O

This	O
rhetoric	O
and	O
its	O
appeal	O
to	O
certain	O
segments	O

might	O
suggest	O
that	O
