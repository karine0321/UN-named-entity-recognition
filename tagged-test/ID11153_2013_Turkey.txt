I	O
wish	O
to	O
start	O
by	O
extending	O
our	O
sincere	O
congratulations	O
to	O
Mr.	O
John	I-PER
Ashe	I-PER
on	O
his	O
assumption	O
of	O
the	O
presidency	O
of	O
the	O
General	I-ORG
Assembly	I-ORG
at	O
its	O
sixty-eighth	O
session	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
dawn	O
of	O
the	O
twenty-first	O
century	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
every	O
reason	O
to	O
be	O
optimistic	O
about	O
the	O
future	O
.	O

With	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
Cold	I-MISC
War	I-MISC
,	O
the	O
moral	O
balance	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
shifted	O
towards	O
the	O
pursuit	O
of	O
peace	O
.	O

A	O
lasting	O
peace	O
is	O
far	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
mere	O
absence	O
of	O
war	O
.	O

We	O
,	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
,	O
understood	O
the	O
imperative	O
of	O
working	O
together	O
for	O
a	O
stable	O
world	O
order	O
.	O

We	O
maintain	O
our	O
strong	O
commitment	O
to	O
the	O
universal	O
principles	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
system	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
spirit	O
of	O
solidarity	O
and	O
cooperation	O
,	O
we	O
develop	O
effective	O
international	O
responses	O
to	O
the	O
scourge	O
of	O
terrorism	O
.	O

Yet	O
the	O
most	O
profound	O
crises	O
of	O
our	O
times	O
have	O
been	O
emerging	O
from	O
internal	O
conflicts	O
.	O

Such	O
conflicts	O
have	O
been	O
increasing	O
in	O
both	O
frequency	O
and	O
magnitude	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
largely	O
driven	O
by	O
the	O
problem	O
of	O
political	O
legitimacy	O
,	O
which	O
leads	O
the	O
governed	O
to	O
withhold	O
their	O
consent	O
and	O
limits	O
the	O
prospects	O
for	O
domestic	O
order	O
.	O

Leaders	O
without	O
political	O
legitimacy	O
share	O
a	O
common	O
delusion	O
.	O

Instead	O
of	O
reading	O
the	O
future	O
and	O
leading	O
transformation	O
,	O
they	O
believe	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
buy	O
time	O
with	O
irresponsible	O
actions	O
against	O
their	O
own	O
people	O
.	O

Eventually	O
,	O
those	O
domestic	O
conflicts	O
escalate	O
into	O
civil	O
wars	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
tragedy	O
we	O
are	O
witnessing	O
in	O
Syria	I-LOC
.	O

The	O
actions	O
of	O
those	O
leaders	O
have	O
implications	O
for	O
peace	O
and	O
security	O
beyond	O
their	O
own	O
borders	O
.	O

If	O
some	O
leaders	O
insist	O
on	O
defining	O
their	O
security	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
inflicts	O
insecurity	O
upon	O
other	O
nations	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
collective	O
security	O
.	O

Today	O
regional	O
and	O
international	O
peace	O
and	O
security	O
depend	O
upon	O
the	O
maintenance	O
of	O
domestic	O
order	O
in	O
each	O
￼individual	O
nation	O
.	O

True	O
domestic	O
peace	O
is	O
the	O
key	O
to	O
regional	O
and	O
international	O
peace	O
and	O
stability	O
That	O
is	O
a	O
challenge	O
that	O
we	O
will	O
continue	O
to	O
face	O
in	O
the	O
years	O

We	O
all	O
know	O
that	O
no	O
one	O
holds	O
a	O

yet	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
touch	O
upon	O
the	O
function	O
of	O
the	O

United	I-ORG

We	O
all	O

a	O
strong	O

We	O

for	O
its	O

current	O

The	O
United	I-ORG

of	O
which	O
I	O

should	O
be	O
a	O
body	O
capable	O
of	O
taking	O
action	O
to	O
maintain	O
international	O
peace	O

It	O
should	O
be	O

justice	O
and	O
the	O
people	O

It	O
should	O
never	O
forfeit	O
its	O
prime	O
responsibility	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O

.	O

We	O
must	O
realize	O
that	O
inaction	O
by	O
the	O
Security	I-ORG
Council	I-ORG
only	O
emboldens	O
aggressive	O

We	O
need	O
a	O
United	I-ORG

capable	O
of	O
forcing	O
the	O
perpetrators	O
of	O
brutal	O
actions	O
to	O
submit	O
to	O
justice	O
and	O
the	O
rule	O
of	O

Only	O
through	O

can	O

achieve	O
the	O
truly	O

envisioned	O

Yet	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
that	O
remains	O
a	O
noble	O
goal	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
also	O
an	O
urgent	O
necessity	O

Decisive	O
action	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
that	O
the	O
United	I-ORG

will	O
remain	O
relevant	O
and	O

To	O
face	O
that	O

we	O

that	O

and	O

No	O
issue	O
facing	O
us	O
is	O
more	O
pressing	O
than	O
the	O
situation	O
in	O
Syria	I-LOC
.	O

Let	O
me	O
be	O
clear	O
.	O

Turkey	I-LOC
welcomes	O
and	O
firmly	O
supports	O
the	O
United	I-LOC
States-Russian	I-MISC
agreement	O
to	O
eliminate	O
Syria	I-LOC
's	O
arsenal	O
of	O
chemical	O
weapons	O
.	O

That	O
agreement	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
translated	O
into	O
a	O
tangible	O
Security	I-ORG
Council	I-ORG
resolution	O
.	O

When	O
Syria	I-LOC
comes	O
clean	O
about	O
its	O
arsenal	O
,	O
once	O
and	O
for	O
all	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
relief	O
for	O
the	O
Syrian	I-MISC
people	O
and	O
the	O
region	O
.	O

As	O
Syria	I-LOC
's	O
neighbour	O
,	O
Turkey	I-LOC
will	O
appreciate	O
more	O
than	O
most	O
the	O
complete	O
and	O
verifiable	O
destruction	O
of	O
those	O
weapons	O
.	O

Nevertheless	O
,	O
we	O
cannot	O
forget	O
that	O
chemical	O
weapons	O
were	O
used	O
against	O
Syrian	I-MISC
civilians	O
only	O
a	O
month	O
ago	O
.	O

The	O
perpetrators	O
of	O
that	O
crime	O
against	O
humanity	O
must	O
be	O
held	O
accountable	O
and	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
justice	O
.	O

I	O
also	O
see	O
the	O
agreement	O
on	O
Syrian	I-MISC
chemical	O
weapons	O
as	O
an	O
opportunity	O
.	O

I	O
hope	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
first	O
step	O
in	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
a	O
security	O
architecture	O
to	O
ensure	O
the	O
elimination	O
of	O
all	O
weapons	O
of	O
mass	O
destruction	O
in	O
the	O
Middle	I-LOC
East	I-LOC
.	O

Yet	O
the	O
recent	O
approach	O
to	O
the	O
situation	O
in	O
Syria	I-LOC
also	O
raises	O
difficult	O
questions	O
.	O

Were	O
it	O
not	O
for	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
chemical	O
weapons	O
,	O
would	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
have	O
continued	O
to	O
turn	O
a	O
blind	O
eye	O
to	O
the	O
deaths	O
of	O
more	O
than	O
100,000	O
people	O
?	O

For	O
how	O
long	O
can	O
we	O
afford	O
to	O
evade	O
our	O
moral	O
responsibility	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
being	O
killed	O
even	O
as	O
we	O
speak	O
here	O
?	O

The	O
conflict	O
neither	O
began	O
with	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
chemical	O
weapons	O
nor	O
will	O
it	O
end	O
with	O
an	O
agreement	O
to	O
eliminate	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
therefore	O
bluntly	O
reject	O
any	O
position	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
troubled	O
by	O
the	O
killing	O
of	O
innocent	O
people	O
in	O
itself	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
by	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
such	O
killing	O
.	O

Such	O
an	O
approach	O
is	O
immoral	O
and	O
totally	O
unacceptable	O
.	O

The	O
agreement	O
to	O
destroy	O
Syria	I-LOC
's	O
chemical	O
arsenal	O
must	O
not	O
allow	O
the	O
regime	O
to	O
avoid	O
responsibility	O
for	O
its	O
other	O
crimes	O

Syria	I-LOC
,	O
a	O

and	O
a	O
great	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
disgrace	O
that	O
the	O
Security	I-ORG
Council	I-ORG
has	O
failed	O
to	O
uphold	O
its	O
primary	O
responsibility	O
in	O
that	O
case	O

It	O
is	O
deeply	O
regrettable	O
that	O
political	O
differences	O
,	O
balance-of-power	O
politics	O
and	O
geopolitical	O
considerations	O
have	O
prevailed	O
over	O
the	O
imperative	O
to	O
end	O
the	O
tragedy	O
.	O

Staying	O
on	O
this	O
course	O
cannot	O
be	O
an	O
option	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
tragedy	O
began	O
,	O
we	O
spoke	O
of	O
the	O
killing	O
of	O
hundreds	O
of	O

thousands	O

we	O

If	O
we	O

the	O

rest	O

that	O
we	O
will	O
be	O

I	O
cannot	O
emphasize	O
this	O
enough	O

Agreement	O
on	O
chemical	O

must	O
not	O
be	O

to	O
address	O
the	O

Any	O

damage	O
on	O
the	O

the	O

expansion	O
of	O
the	O

The	O
case	O

the	O

Those	O

the	O

Another	O
area	O
where	O

￼Another	O
