This	O
new	O
session	O
of	O
the	O
Assembly	I-ORG
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
brings	O
us	O
together	O
at	O
what	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O
an	O
historic	O
time	O
of	O
great	O
importance	O
,	O
as	O
has	O
been	O
said	O
in	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
another	O
by	O
the	O
various	O
leaders	O
who	O
have	O
preceded	O
me	O
at	O
this	O
rostrum	O
.	O

These	O
are	O
certainly	O
critical	O
times	O
that	O
should	O
lead	O
us	O
to	O
adopt	O
an	O
attitude	O
that	O
goes	O
beyond	O
addressing	O
the	O
specific	O
questions	O
of	O
the	O
moment	O
,	O
because	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
moment	O
of	O
change	O
in	O
the	O
history	O
of	O
humankind	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
economic	O
,	O
social	O
and	O
geopolitical	O
levels	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
signs	O
indeed	O
that	O
show	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
world	O
is	O
changing	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
transition	O
towards	O
something	O
new	O
,	O
even	O
if	O
still	O
undefined	O
,	O
is	O
already	O
under	O
way	O
and	O
will	O
follow	O
its	O
course	O
,	O
whether	O
we	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
understand	O
it	O
or	O
not	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
our	O
peoples	O
desire	O
political	O
leadership	O
that	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
respond	O
to	O
this	O
time	O
of	O
uncertainty	O
.	O

Our	O
societies	O
demand	O
of	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
be	O
able	O
,	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
,	O
to	O
understand	O
and	O
explain	O
to	O
them	O
what	O
is	O
really	O
going	O
on	O
.	O

They	O
also	O
demand	O
of	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
listen	O
to	O
their	O
needs	O
and	O
satisfy	O
those	O
needs	O
and	O
,	O
above	O
all	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
reach	O
a	O
new	O
international	O
consensus	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
make	O
that	O
necessary	O
qualitative	O
global	O
leap	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
achieve	O
a	O
planet	O
of	O
greater	O
justice	O
,	O
stability	O
and	O
safety	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
reconsider	O
our	O
policies	O
,	O
to	O
review	O
and	O
change	O
paradigms	O
that	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
frozen	O
,	O
to	O
renew	O
the	O
international	O
debate	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
ambitious	O
in	O
our	O
aspirations	O
as	O
a	O
global	O
society	O
.	O

Members	O
know	O
that	O
nothing	O
undermines	O
the	O
morale	O
and	O
spirit	O
of	O
our	O
peoples	O
more	O
than	O
fear	O
,	O
uncertainty	O
and	O
distrust	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
those	O
evils	O
that	O
are	O
affecting	O
our	O
planet	O
currently	O
.	O

We	O
are	O
suffering	O
from	O
fear	O
in	O
its	O
various	O
guises	O
.	O

Millions	O
of	O
demoralized	O
,	O
unemployed	O
people	O
live	O
in	O
daily	O
uncertainty	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
whether	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
future	O
for	O
them	O
and	O
their	O
children	O
.	O

Entire	O
countries	O
have	O
seen	O
their	O
economies	O
stumble	O
because	O
of	O
that	O
lack	O
of	O
confidence	O
.	O

Hundreds	O
of	O
thousands	O
of	O
families	O
every	O
day	O
face	O
the	O
fear	O
that	O
takes	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
political	O
instability	O
,	O
natural	O
disasters	O
,	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
urban	O
safety	O
,	O
and	O
poverty	O
.	O

All	O
those	O
people	O
demand	O
that	O
their	O
leaders	O
give	O
them	O
the	O
inspiration	O
to	O
overcome	O
that	O
fear	O
,	O
to	O
regain	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
collective	O
self-esteem	O
and	O
to	O
believe	O
in	O
a	O
different	O
and	O
better	O
future	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
the	O
great	O
historical	O
challenge	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
shoulder	O
with	O
responsibility	O
and	O
courage	O
.	O

We	O
must	O
forge	O
a	O
new	O
international	O
agreement	O
that	O
will	O
allow	O
us	O
to	O
overcome	O
such	O
fears	O
and	O
lack	O
of	O
confidence	O
in	O
order	O
once	O
again	O
to	O
stride	O
forward	O
.	O

Therefore	O
we	O
must	O
not	O
allow	O
that	O
fear	O
to	O
be	O
translated	O
into	O
timid	O
or	O
cowardly	O
political	O
and	O
economic	O
decisions	O
that	O
would	O
deprive	O
us	O
of	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
undertake	O
the	O
changes	O
that	O
our	O
people	O
are	O
calling	O
for	O
.	O

We	O
must	O
not	O
betray	O
their	O
historic	O
will	O
for	O
transformation	O
and	O
development	O
.	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
unpardonable	O
,	O
unforgivable	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
allow	O
ourselves	O
to	O
be	O
lulled	O
by	O
old	O
political	O
and	O
economic	O
dogma	O
and	O
continue	O
repeating	O
once	O
again	O
the	O
same	O
mistakes	O
,	O
while	O
overwhelming	O
majorities	O
in	O
every	O
city	O
,	O
in	O
every	O
State	O
,	O
on	O
every	O
continent	O
,	O
have	O
clearly	O
expressed	O
their	O
desire	O
for	O
a	O
new	O
,	O
audacious	O
and	O
creative	O
policy	O
.	O

Over	O
the	O
past	O
30	O
years	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
economy	O
has	O
grown	O
exponentially	O
,	O
so	O
has	O
the	O
root	O
cause	O
of	O
many	O
of	O
our	O
misfortunes	O
,	O
and	O
here	O
I	O
am	O
referring	O
to	O
injustice	O
.	O

Daily	O
injustice	O
has	O
a	O
most	O
significant	O
effect	O
on	O
our	O
peoples	O
.	O

It	O
affects	O
their	O
options	O
for	O
health	O
,	O
education	O
and	O
social	O
development	O
in	O
very	O
tangible	O
ways	O
.	O

That	O
inequality	O
has	O
disastrous	O
consequences	O
,	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
tried	O
,	O
tested	O
and	O
understood	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
wealthiest	O
entrepreneurs	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
paying	O
more	O
taxes	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
are	O
aware	O
that	O
adopting	O
any	O
other	O
position	O
would	O
sentence	O
us	O
to	O
a	O
harsh	O
future	O
,	O
even	O
for	O
those	O
living	O
at	O
ease	O
.	O

The	O
fight	O
against	O
poverty	O
and	O
inequality	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
recalled	O
at	O
the	O
inaugural	O
meeting	O
of	O
this	O
session	O
of	O
the	O
General	I-ORG
Assembly	I-ORG
by	O
the	O
President	O
of	O
Brazil	I-LOC
,	O
Dilma	I-PER
Rousseff	I-PER
,	O
has	O
proven	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
strongest	O
economic	O
policy	O
in	O
these	O
difficult	O
times	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
time	O
that	O
we	O
no	O
longer	O
see	O
our	O
future	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
macroeconomic	O
data	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
start	O
to	O
focus	O
our	O
political	O
debate	O
on	O
our	O
peoples'	O
needs	O
and	O
on	O
social	O
justice	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
what	O
the	O
debate	O
should	O
always	O
have	O
focused	O
on	O
.	O

Any	O
other	O
debate	O
would	O
be	O
sterile	O
and	O
would	O
only	O
lead	O
us	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
common	O
objective	O
that	O
should	O
govern	O
all	O
our	O
policies	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
the	O
objective	O
of	O
the	O
common	O
good	O
.	O

The	O
unstable	O
reality	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
experienced	O
also	O
takes	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
conflicts	O
which	O
,	O
increasingly	O
,	O
call	O
upon	O
the	O
indistinct	O
arbiter	O
,	O
who	O
goes	O
by	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O
"	O
international	O
community	O
"	O
and	O
which	O
is	O
represented	O
here	O
in	O
the	O
General	I-ORG
Assembly	I-ORG
better	O
than	O
anywhere	O
else	O
.	O

In	O
that	O
regard	O
I	O
welcome	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
central	O
themes	O
of	O
this	O
session	O
is	O
the	O
search	O
for	O
the	O
peaceful	O
settlement	O
of	O
conflicts	O
and	O
prevention	O
strategies	O
to	O
cope	O
with	O
situations	O
of	O
instability	O
.	O

This	O
shows	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
arbiter	O
is	O
growing	O
stronger	O
,	O
as	O
are	O
the	O
possibilities	O
to	O
prevent	O
injustice	O
and	O
human	O
rights	O
abuses	O
wherever	O
they	O
occur	O
.	O

The	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
arose	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
global	O
desire	O
to	O
avoid	O
a	O
new	O
major	O
conflict	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
spirit	O
of	O
peace	O
and	O
harmony	O
must	O
continue	O
to	O
guide	O
us	O
in	O
our	O
actions	O
,	O
even	O
when	O
the	O
conflicts	O
that	O
we	O
face	O
currently	O
are	O
very	O
different	O
from	O
the	O
conflicts	O
of	O
the	O
twentieth	O
century	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
living	O
in	O
a	O
most	O
diverse	O
and	O
complex	O
world	O
where	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
magical	O
formulas	O
or	O
quick	O
fixes	O
but	O
common	O
responsibility	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
committed	O
to	O
finding	O
new	O
avenues	O
for	O
peacemaking	O
and	O
justice	O
extending	O
beyond	O
our	O
national	O
borders	O
.	O

That	O
resolve	O
must	O
also	O
translate	O
into	O
our	O
quest	O
for	O
solutions	O
to	O
what	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
oldest	O
conflicts	O
on	O
this	O
planet	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
referring	O

to	O
the	O
Arab-Israeli	I-MISC
conflict	O

As	O
members	O
know	O
,	O
my	O
country	O
recently	O
decided	O
to	O
recognize	O
the	O
Palestinian	I-MISC
State	O

This	O
in	O
no	O
way	O
seeks	O
to	O
undermine	O
our	O
good	O
diplomatic	O
relations	O
with	O
Israel	I-LOC

We	O
are	O
of	O
the	O
view	O
that	O
both	O
peoples	O
have	O
the	O
right	O
and	O
duty	O
to	O

Recognizing	O
Palestine	I-LOC
as	O
a	O
new	O
State	O
within	O
the	O
United	I-ORG

is	O

in	O
my	O
opinion	O

the	O
right	O
way	O
to	O

to	O

the	O

With	O
this	O
firm	O

we	O
support	O
all	O

that	O

aimed	O
at	O
achieving	O
a	O
peaceful	O
settlement	O
of	O
this	O
long-	O
standing	O
conflict	O

We	O
firmly	O
believe	O
that	O
dialogue	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
possible	O
solution	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
actions	O
have	O
always	O
been	O
guided	O
by	O
that	O
principle	O

Now	O
I	O

Consider	O
this:	O
$100	O

across	O

with	O
a	O
veritable	O

of	O

scepticism	O
that	O
leads	O
me	O
to	O
speak	O
this	O
way	O
but	O
rather	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
realism	O
in	O
keeping	O
with	O
the	O
reality	O
experienced	O
by	O
Central	I-MISC
American	I-MISC
peoples	O
on	O
a	O
daily	O
basis	O
.	O

I	O
wish	O
to	O
draw	O
attention	O
to	O
this	O
.	O

The	O
international	O
community	O
must	O
understand	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
also	O
affected	O
by	O
this	O
problem	O
.	O

No	O
nation	O
on	O
this	O
planet	O
is	O
spared	O
this	O
problem	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
drug	O
users	O
in	O
every	O
nation	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
who	O
get	O
their	O
drugs	O
from	O
the	O
criminal	O
drug-trafficking	O
networks	O
.	O

That	O
means	O
that	O
the	O
fight	O
against	O
organized	O
crime	O
is	O
a	O
common	O
struggle	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
that	O
regard	O
,	O
I	O
wish	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
special	O
and	O
hopeful	O
call	O
upon	O
the	O
people	O
and	O
Government	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-LOC
States	I-LOC
resolutely	O
to	O
lead	O
us	O
in	O
this	O
the	O
good	O
fight	O
against	O
drug-trafficking	O
and	O
organized	O
crime	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
Government	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-LOC
States	I-LOC
must	O
lead	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
struggle	O
with	O
great	O
resolve	O
.	O

It	O
must	O
make	O
the	O
commitment	O
and	O
apply	O
all	O
its	O
economic	O
,	O
human	O
,	O
technological	O
and	O
political	O
resources	O
in	O
waging	O
the	O
struggle	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
indeed	O
the	O
harshest	O
war	O
to	O
affect	O
our	O
continent	O
.	O

The	O
violence	O
that	O
is	O
fuelled	O
by	O
drugs	O
trafficking	O
and	O
by	O
its	O
machinery	O
of	O
death	O
has	O
taken	O
more	O
lives	O
in	O
Mesoamerica	I-LOC
than	O
conflicts	O
that	O
occur	O
elsewhere	O
on	O
this	O
planet	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
I	O
wish	O
to	O
draw	O
attention	O
to	O
and	O
invite	O
all	O
Members	O
to	O
focus	O
on	O
this	O
shocking	O
fact	O
.	O

We	O
require	O
the	O
firm	O
resolve	O
of	O
our	O
great	O
North	I-MISC
American	I-MISC
neighbour	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
strike	O
the	O
necessary	O
blows	O
to	O
weaken	O
and	O
end	O
this	O
criminal	O
phenomenon	O
.	O

Naturally	O
,	O
that	O
does	O
not	O
mean	O
that	O
our	O
countries	O
will	O
in	O
any	O
way	O
shirk	O
their	O
share	O
of	O
the	O
responsibility	O
.	O

We	O
shall	O
continue	O
to	O
strengthen	O
our	O
institutions	O
,	O
to	O
reform	O
our	O
security	O
forces	O
,	O
to	O
strengthen	O
our	O
presence	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
protect	O
our	O
young	O
people	O
from	O
criminal	O
gangs	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
regional	O
level	O
we	O
are	O
working	O
together	O
and	O
have	O
undertaken	O
significant	O
steps	O
in	O
a	O
common	O
undertaking	O
by	O
sharing	O
strategies	O
and	O
tasks	O
with	O
Mexico	I-LOC
,	O
Colombia	I-LOC
and	O
the	O
United	I-LOC
States	I-LOC
.	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
these	O
are	O
truly	O
difficult	O
challenges	O
that	O
lie	O
ahead	O
.	O

Many	O
of	O
these	O
challenges	O
were	O
referred	O
to	O
by	O
the	O
President	O
of	O
Mexico	I-LOC
‚Äî	O
the	O
fight	O
against	O
money-laundering	O
,	O

prevention	O

an	O
effective	O
judiciary	O
‚Äî	O
and	O
will	O
require	O
the	O
reform	O
of	O
our	O

Inevitably	O

organized	O

has	O
infiltrated	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
State	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
the	O
judiciary	O
and	O
the	O
police	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
we	O
must	O
wage	O
a	O
strong	O
fight	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
clean	O
up	O
those	O
institutions	O

But	O
the	O
consumer	O
countries	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
chiefly	O
the	O
United	I-LOC
States	I-LOC
,	O
are	O
morally	O
responsible	O
in	O
this	O
struggle	O
that	O
must	O
be	O
seen	O
not	O
only	O
as	O
a	O
criminal	O
problem	O
but	O
also	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
public	O
health	O
.	O

While	O
drugs	O
consumption	O
and	O
narcotics	O
use	O
grow	O
,	O
the	O
business	O
of	O
drugs	O
trafficking	O
will	O
remain	O
powerful	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
we	O
call	O
once	O
again	O
for	O
North	O
American	O
leadership	O
in	O
this	O
common	O
struggle	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
waging	O
alongside	O
Mexico	I-LOC
,	O
Colombia	I-LOC
and	O
all	O
of	O
Central	I-LOC
America	I-LOC
.	O

Struggles	O
such	O
as	O
these	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
being	O
waged	O
across	O
the	O
American	I-MISC
continent	O
,	O
once	O
again	O
show	O
how	O
important	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
strong	O
and	O
united	O
America	I-LOC
.	O

Unity	O
is	O
a	O
necessary	O
prerequisite	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
meet	O
our	O
common	O
goals	O
.	O

Given	O
this	O
need	O
,	O
I	O
now	O
wish	O
to	O
refer	O
to	O
the	O
blockade	O
against	O
the	O
Republic	I-LOC
of	I-LOC
Cuba	I-LOC
.	O

We	O
believe	O
that	O
this	O
blockade	O
is	O
an	O
anachronism	O
from	O
a	O
past	O
page	O
of	O
history	O
that	O
we	O
wish	O
to	O
turn	O
once	O
and	O
for	O
all	O
.	O

Essentially	O
a	O
blockade	O
against	O
Cuba	I-LOC
is	O
a	O
step	O
towards	O
disunity	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
stumbling	O
block	O
on	O
the	O
road	O
of	O
history	O
that	O
weakens	O
us	O
as	O
a	O
continent	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
my	O
statement	O
I	O
spoke	O
of	O
the	O
leadership	O
that	O
our	O
peoples	O
expect	O
from	O
us	O
in	O
these	O
difficult	O
times	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
courage	O
that	O
we	O
need	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
face	O
the	O
challenges	O
that	O
extend	O
beyond	O
our	O
borders	O
and	O
also	O
of	O
this	O
great	O
opportunity	O
before	O
us	O
now	O
.	O

Let	O
us	O
show	O
that	O
leadership	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
smallest	O
country	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
my	O
own	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
Powers	O
.	O

Let	O
us	O
show	O
an	O
unequivocal	O
will	O
to	O
achieve	O
peace	O
,	O
social	O
justice	O
and	O
the	O
well-being	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
who	O
place	O
their	O
faith	O
in	O
us	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
in	O
times	O
such	O
as	O
these	O
when	O
crisis	O
once	O
again	O
threatens	O
our	O
peoples	O
.	O

Let	O
us	O
not	O
fail	O
them	O
once	O
more	O
.	O

We	O
should	O
not	O
favour	O
those	O
in	O
power	O
who	O
triggered	O
the	O
crisis	O
but	O
rather	O
the	O
weakest	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
affected	O
by	O
it	O
