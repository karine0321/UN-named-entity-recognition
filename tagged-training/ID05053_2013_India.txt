Setting	O
the	O

for	O
the	O
post-2015	O

agenda	O
is	O
especially	O
important	O
as	O
we	O
deal	O
with	O
a	O
lingering	O
global	O
economic	O
slowdown	O
and	O
continuing	O
volatility	O
in	O
financial	O

These	O
have	O
imposed	O

heavy	O
costs	O
on	O
developing	O
countries	O
and	O
the	O
vulnerable	O
groups	O
within	O
them	O

Growth	O
and	O
inclusive	O
development	O
are	O
naturally	O
important	O
for	O
all	O
our	O
countries	O

They	O
require	O
a	O
supportive	O
international	O
economic	O

including	O
from	O

the	O

Poverty	O
remains	O
a	O

economic	O
challenge	O

and	O
its	O
eradication	O
requires	O
special	O
attention	O

a	O
new	O
collective	O
thrust	O
.	O

That	O
priority	O
should	O
anchor	O
the	O
post-2015	O

agenda	O
,	O
which	O
should	O
be	O
shaped	O
by	O

important	O
and	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
addressed	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
will	O
fall	O
short	O
of	O
realizing	O
an	O
ambitious	O
post-2015	O
development	O
agenda	O
if	O
we	O
focus	O
merely	O
on	O
governance	O
issues	O
at	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
robust	O
economic	O
growth	O

This	O
agenda	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
merely	O
about	O
reprioritizing	O
domestic	O

,	O
but	O
also	O
about	O
fostering	O
genuine	O
international	O
partnerships	O
between	O
developing	O

developed	O

to	O
bring	O
about	O
