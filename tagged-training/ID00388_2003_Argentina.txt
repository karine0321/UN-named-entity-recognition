On	O

We	O
have	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
world	O
's	O
South	O
to	O
the	O
General	I-ORG
Assembly	I-ORG
with	O
a	O
firm	O
belief	O
that	O
revitalizing	O
this	O
global	O
representative	O
forum	O
is	O
essential	O
for	O
international	O
law	O
to	O
become	O
once	O
again	O
a	O
rational	O
instrument	O
for	O
resolving	O

Restoring	O
the	O
major	O
political	O
role	O
that	O
the	O
Assembly	I-ORG
played	O
in	O
the	O
early	O
days	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG

is	O
key	O
to	O
strengthening	O
security	O
for	O
all	O
citizens	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
multilateralism	O
is	O
the	O
cornerstone	O
of	O
this	O
Organization	I-ORG
.	O

But	O
the	O
cold	O
war	O
and	O
bipolarity	O
that	O
characterized	O
the	O
world	O
after	O
the	O
Yalta	I-LOC
Conference	I-MISC
until	O
the	O
fall	O
of	O
the	O
Berlin	I-LOC

undoubtedly	O
shaped	O
the	O
instruments	O
and	O
legislation	O
that	O
were	O
adopted	O
within	O
that	O
framework	O
.	O

Any	O
objective	O
look	O

the	O
international	O
situation	O
that	O
that	O
goes	O
beyond	O
the	O
particular	O
biases	O
of	O
individual	O
Members	O
of	O
the	O
Organization	I-ORG
will	O
reveal	O
another	O
hallmark	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
today:	O
the	O
technological	O
,	O
military	O
and	O
economic	O
supremacy	O
of	O
one	O
country	O
over	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

We	O
therefore	O
consider	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
reaffirm	O
our	O
determined	O
support	O
for	O
the	O
purposes	O
and	O
principles	O
that	O
underpin	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
can	O
actively	O
work	O
to	O
promote	O
peace	O
and	O
the	O
social	O
and	O
economic	O
development	O
of	O
humanity	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
it	O
bears	O
repeating	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
not	O
limit	O
our	O
commitment	O
to	O
multilateralism	O
to	O
words	O
alone	O
.	O

Promoting	O
multilateralism	O
requires	O
a	O
dual	O
strategy	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
an	O
open	O
mind	O
is	O
needed	O
to	O
objectively	O
grasp	O
the	O
full	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
state	O
of	O
affairs	O
.	O

Secondly	O
,	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
reconsider	O
the	O
instruments	O
and	O
rules	O
so	O
to	O
cope	O
with	O
this	O
new	O
reality	O
just	O
as	O
was	O
done	O
during	O
the	O
era	O
of	O
bipolar	O
politics	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
save	O
the	O
world	O
from	O
destruction	O
.	O

Multilateralism	O
and	O
security	O
are	O
inseparable	O
but	O
are	O
not	O
the	O
only	O
factors	O
in	O
this	O
new	O
equation	O
.	O

The	O
world	O
is	O
changing	O
against	O
the	O
backdrop	O
of	O
a	O
globalization	O
that	O
is	O
creating	O
unprecedented	O
opportunities	O
and	O
risks	O
.	O

The	O
greatest	O
risk	O
is	O
the	O
widening	O
gap	O
between	O
the	O
rich	O
and	O
poor	O
.	O

To	O
divide	O
the	O
world	O
into	O
central	O
and	O
marginal	O
countries	O
is	O
not	O
merely	O
an	O
academic	O
exercise	O
or	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
ideology	O
.	O

Quite	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
such	O
definitions	O
reflect	O
a	O
grim	O
reality	O
of	O
unprecedented	O
poverty	O
and	O
social	O
exclusion	O
.	O

Our	O
priority	O
must	O
be	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
globalization	O
works	O
for	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
just	O
for	O
the	O
few	O
.	O

Promoting	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
the	O
marginalized	O

is	O
no	O
longer	O
simply	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
social	O
conscience	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
central	O
countries	O

It	O
has	O
an	O

on	O
their	O
situation	O
and	O

Hunger	O

They	O
also	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

Economic	O

political	O
multilateralism	O

the	O
key	O
to	O

We	O

within	O
the	O

to	O
bolster	O

for	O
the	O

of	O
those	O

If	O
we	O
are	O
to	O
promote	O
collective	O
security	O
intelligently	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
understand	O
that	O

is	O
not	O

a	O

it	O
depends	O
on	O

These	O

the	O

on	O
the	O

that	O

burden	O
of	O

owed	O
to	O
multilateral	O

We	O
accept	O
our	O
share	O
of	O

for	O
having	O
adopted	O

that	O
caused	O
this	O

But	O
we	O
also	O
call	O
on	O
the	O
international	O
financial	O
institutions	O

which	O
contributed	O

the	O

This	O

places	O
the	O

in	O
a	O
dimension	O
