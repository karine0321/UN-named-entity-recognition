you	O

I	O
should	O
also	O
like	O
to	O
express	O
,	O
on	O
behalf	O
of	O
the	O
European	I-ORG
Union	I-LOC
and	O
all	O
its	O
member	O

,	O
our	O
deepest	O
sympathy	O

particularly	O
those	O

In	O
early	O
July	O
,	O
my	O
first	O
duty	O
in	O
the	O
presidency	O
of	O
the	O
European	I-ORG

was	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Srebrenica	O
to	O
mark	O
the	O
tenth	O
anniversary	O
of	O
the	O
massacre	O
there	O
,	O
the	O
worst	O
in	O
Europe	O
since	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
Second	O

War	O
.	O

More	O
than	O
8	O
,000	O
people	O
,	O
mainly	O

were	O
taken	O
away	O

killed	O

the	O
international	O
community	O
just	O
stood	O
to	O
one	O

To	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
shown	O
the	O
right	O
convictions	O
in	O
words	O
,	O
but	O
shamefully	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
failed	O
to	O
act	O

The	O
lesson	O
of	O
that	O
massacre	O
—	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
even	O
greater	O
horror	O
of	O
Rwanda	I-LOC
a	O
year	O
before	O
—	O
was	O
that	O
we	O
all	O
needed	O
better	O
means	O
to	O
turn	O
our	O
collective	O
will	O
into	O
decisive	O
action	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
we	O
in	O
the	O
European	I-ORG
Union	I-LOC
have	O
learned	O
in	O
the	O
intervening	O
period	O

Today	O
,	O
the	O

in	O

I	O
also	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
has	O
learned	O
the	O
lessons	O
of	O
the	O
past	O
decade	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
summit	O
this	O
week	O
,	O
we	O
agreed	O
on	O
the	O
further	O
steps	O
that	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
take	O
for	O
the	O
Organization	O
to	O
be	O
even	O
more	O
effective	O
.	O

Of	I-LOC
all	O
that	O
was	O
agreed	O
at	O
the	O
summit	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
agreement	O
on	O
our	O

"	O
responsibility	O
to	O
protect	O
"	O

that	O
will	O
be	O
seen	O
in	O
the	O
future	O
as	O
having	O
the	O
greatest	O
significance	O
of	O
all	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
follow	O
through	O
on	O
the	O
responsibility	O
to	O
protect	O
,	O
then	O
never	O
again	O
will	O
genocide	O
,	O
ethnic	O
cleansing	O
and	O
crimes	O
against	O
humanity	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
take	O
place	O
under	O
our	O
noses	O
with	O
nothing	O
done	O
.	O

The	O
responsibility	O
to	O
protect	O
is	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
a	O
reflection	O
of	O
our	O
common	O
morality	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
is	O
also	O
a	O
recognition	O
that	O
the	O
world	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
now	O
live	O
is	O
too	O
small	O
for	O
us	O
to	O

the	O

This	O

been	O
