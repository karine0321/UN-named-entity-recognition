called	O
on	O

international	O
community	O
from	O
the	O
podium	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
General	I-ORG

to	O
create	O
a	O
global	O
system	O
of	O
counteraction	O
to	O
present-day	O
threats	O
and	O
challenges	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
aimed	O

security	O
and	O
at	O
meeting	O
the	O
vital	O
interests	O
of	O
each	O
and	O

This	O
system	O
would	O
provide	O
for	O
long-term	O
international	O
stability	O
and	O
sustainable	O
development	O
.	O

To	O
be	O
efficient	O
,	O
such	O
a	O
system	O
needs	O
a	O
generally	O
recognized	O
coordinating	O
centre	O
capable	O
of	O
rallying	O
the	O
international	O
community	O

And	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
such	O
a	O
centre	O
—	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
with	O
its	O
unique	O
legitimacy	O
,	O
universality	O
and	O
experience	O
.	O

Our	O
common	O
task	O
is	O
to	O
unite	O
around	O
the	O
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
to	O
provide	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
necessary	O
potential	O
and	O
resources	O
and	O
to	O
develop	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
its	O
internal	O
reserves	O
.	O

Today	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
state	O
with	O
satisfaction	O
that	O
the	O
global	O
system	O
is	O
already	O
evolving	O
and	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
this	O
process	O
is	O
largely	O
successful	O
.	O

We	O
suggest	O
that	O
an	O
additional	O
impetus	O
should	O
be	O
given	O
to	O
this	O
process	O
and	O
a	O
resolution	O
to	O
encourage	O
a	O
most	O
prompt	O
creation	O
of	O
a	O
global	O
system	O
of	O
counteraction	O
to	O
present-day	O
threats	O
and	O
challenges	O
should	O
be	O
adopted	O
at	O
this	O
session	O
of	O
the	O
General	I-ORG
Assembly	I-ORG
.	O

By	O
doing	O
so	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
direct	O
all	O
States	O
towards	O
the	O
joint	O
elaboration	O
of	O
its	O
general	O
shape	O
and	O
parameters	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
even	O
more	O
relevant	O
because	O
some	O
of	O
its	O
parameters	O
are	O
already	O
visible	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
apparent	O
that	O
the	O
system	O
to	O
be	O
created	O
must	O
be:	O
–	O
Global	O
,	O
as	O
modern	O
challenges	O
in	O
the	O
context	O
of	O
globalization	O
pose	O
a	O
universal	O
threat	O
,	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
addressed	O
at	O
the	O
global	O
level	O
.	O

–	O
Comprehensive	O
in	O
scope	O
,	O
as	O
each	O
of	O
the	O
modern	O
threats	O
bears	O
a	O
huge	O
destructive	O
potential	O
and	O
all	O
such	O
problems	O
without	O
exceptions	O
should	O
be	O
embraced	O
by	O
the	O
system	O
.	O

–	O
Holistic	O
in	O
approach	O
,	O
as	O
quite	O
often	O
the	O
new	O
threats	O
and	O
challenges	O
are	O
directly	O
interrelated	O
.	O

–	O
Universal	O
in	O
participation	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
the	O
system	O
should	O
become	O
a	O
reflection	O
of	O
the	O
international	O
rule	O
of	O
law	O
,	O
as	O
its	O
power	O
will	O
be	O
built	O
on	O
principles	O
and	O
regulations	O
of	O
international	O
law	O
,	O
the	O
United	I-ORG

all	O

We	O
bear	O
grave	O
responsibility	O
to	O

the	O
model	O

in	O

of	O
a	O
