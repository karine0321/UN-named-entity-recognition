It	O

Reform	O

The	O

the	O

The	O
litmus	O

for	O

would	O

India	I-LOC
's	O
long-standing	O
commitment	O
to	O
universal	O
,	O
non-discriminatory	O
and	O
comprehensive	O
nuclear	O

embodied	O
in	O
the	O
vision	O

late	O
Prime	O

Rajiv	O
Gandhi	O
for	O
a	O
nuclear-free	O

world	O

This	O
vision	O

put	O
forward	O
nearly	O
two	O
decades	O

It	O
remains	O
undiminished	O
today	O

Indeed	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
all	O
the	O
more	O
relevant	O
today	O
,	O
given	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
peaceful	O

We	O
will	O
be	O
bringing	O
proposals	O
to	O
Member	O

this	O

to	O
see	O
how	O
we	O
can	O
refocus	O
on	O
general	O

complete	O
disarmament	O

nuclear	O
disarmament	O

Disarmament	O
is	O
our	O

it	O
subsumes	O

It	O
is	O
well	O

that	O

an	O
impeccable	O

in	O
preventing	O
the	O

India	I-LOC
is	O
ready	O
to	O

the	O
international	O

to	O
develop	O
a	O
new	O
international	O
consensus	O
on	O

The	O
international	O
community	O
needs	O
to	O
intensify	O
the	O
effort	O
to	O
address	O
the	O
very	O
real	O
threat	O
posed	O
by	O
the	O

the	O
ability	O
of	O

them	O

The	O
risk	O
posed	O
by	O
the	O
intersection	O
between	O
proliferation	O
and	O
terrorism	O
is	O
real	O
and	O
serious	O

The	O
central	O
objective	O
must	O
be	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
our	O
solidarity	O
in	O
words	O
is	O
translated	O
into	O
action	O

The	O
adoption	O
of	O
the	O
United	I-ORG

Global	O
Counter-Terrorism	O
Strategy	O
last	O
September	O
was	O
a	O

signalling	O
the	O

of	O

to	O

this	O

the	O

there	O
is	O
much	O
more	O
that	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
to	O
combat	O
the	O
menace	O
that	O
international	O
terrorism	O
has	O
become	O
.	O

India	I-LOC
is	O
convinced	O
that	O
without	O
the	O
early	O
adoption	O
of	O
a	O
comprehensive	O
convention	O
against	O
international	O
terrorism	O
,	O
the	O
global	O
struggle	O
against	O
terrorism	O
remains	O
incomplete	O
and	O
likely	O
to	O
succeed	O
only	O
partially	O

We	O
must	O
ensure	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
zero	O
tolerance	O
for	O
all	O

of	O
terrorism	O

In	O

I	O
would	O
express	O
the	O
hope	O
that	O
