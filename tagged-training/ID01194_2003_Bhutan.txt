its	O

at	O
a	O
very	O

The	O
historic	O
Millennium	I-MISC

in	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
optimism	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
bring	O
about	O
a	O
world	O
free	O

Unfortunately	O

the	O
horrific	O
events	O

have	O
shaken	O
the	O
very	O
foundations	O
of	O
our	O

faith	O
in	O
our	O
ability	O

deliver	O
a	O

The	O
situation	O

a	O
serious	O
challenge	O
to	O
the	O
international	O

Three	O
years	O

providing	O
a	O

of	O
hope	O
for	O
millions	O

Today	O
,	O
sadly	O
,	O
we	O
stand	O
as	O
a	O
house	O
divided	O

uncertain	O
about	O
the	O
future	O
and	O
unsure	O
whether	O
we	O
can	O
rid	O
the	O
world	O
of	O
the	O
vicious	O
circle	O
of	O
conflict	O
,	O
poverty	O
and	O
fear	O
that	O
has	O
plagued	O
humankind	O
for	O
centuries	O

It	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
international	O
peace	O

security	O

the	O
eradication	O
of	O

remain	O
the	O
most	O

Our	O
collective	O
