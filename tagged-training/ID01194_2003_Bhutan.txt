because	O
of	O
his	O

its	O

role	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
challenging	O
time	O
in	O

The	O
historic	O
Millennium	I-MISC
Summit	I-MISC
ushered	O
in	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
optimism	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
bring	O
about	O
a	O
world	O
free	O
from	O
want	O

Unfortunately	O

the	O
horrific	O
events	O
of	O
11	O

have	O
shaken	O
the	O
very	O
foundations	O
of	O
our	O
nascent	O
faith	O
in	O
our	O
ability	O
to	O
deliver	O
a	O
new	O
era	O

peace	O

The	O
situation	O
in	O

a	O
serious	O
challenge	O
to	O
the	O
international	O

Three	O
years	O
ago	O
,	O
we	O
stood	O

confident	O
about	O

the	O

providing	O
a	O
ray	O
of	O
hope	O
for	O
millions	O
around	O
the	O

Today	O
,	O
sadly	O
,	O
we	O
stand	O
as	O
a	O
house	O
divided	O
,	O
uncertain	O
about	O
the	O
future	O
and	O
unsure	O
whether	O
we	O
can	O
rid	O
the	O
world	O
of	O
the	O
vicious	O
circle	O
of	O
conflict	O
,	O
poverty	O
and	O
fear	O
that	O
has	O
plagued	O
humankind	O
for	O
centuries	O

It	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
international	O
peace	O
and	O
security	O
and	O
the	O
eradication	O
of	O
poverty	O
remain	O
the	O
most	O
pressing	O

What	O

can	O

no	O
prosperity	O

Our	O
collective	O
resolve	O
to	O
