is	O

We	O

that	O
these	O

that	O

We	O
hope	O
that	O
the	O

will	O
support	O
Iraq	I-LOC
and	O
help	O
it	O
to	O
achieve	O
that	O

We	O
believe	O
that	O
security	O
is	O
an	O

A	O

Iraq	I-LOC
will	O
be	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

and	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
as	O
a	O

We	O
have	O
warned	O
all	O
countries	O
in	O
the	O
region	O
that	O
the	O
relentless	O
flow	O
of	O
weapons	O

suicide	O

and	O
the	O
spreading	O
of	O

that	O

only	O
spell	O
disaster	O
for	O
the	O

of	O

the	O
entire	O
world	O

After	O
the	O
Government	O
of	O
National	O
Unity	O
was	O
formed	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
the	O
initiative	O
to	O
improve	O
Iraq	I-LOC
's	O

We	O

took	O

to	O
make	O
our	O

and	O
economically	O
prosperous	O
areas	O
.	O

The	O
foreign	O
policy	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
Iraq	I-LOC
is	O
based	O
on	O
our	O
permanent	O
Constitution	O
,	O
which	O
does	O
not	O
allow	O
our	O
land	O
to	O
be	O
used	O
against	O
our	O
neighbours	O
and	O
prohibits	O
foreign	O
interference	O
in	O
our	O

Today	O
,	O
we	O
feel	O
optimistic	O
that	O
countries	O
in	O
the	O

are	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
the	O
terrorist	O
onslaught	O
against	O
Iraq	I-LOC
and	O
that	O
a	O
weak	O
Iraq	I-LOC
is	O
not	O
in	O
their	O
interests	O

A	O
strong	O
and	O
democratic	O
Iraq	I-LOC
will	O
be	O
a	O
guarantee	O
of	O
security	O
and	O
stability	O
in	O
the	O
region	O
.	O

Because	O
of	O
its	O
new	O
policies	O
,	O
Iraq	I-LOC
has	O
become	O
a	O
place	O
for	O
negotiations	O
and	O
dialogue	O
between	O
feuding	O
regional	O
and	O
international	O
entities	O

We	O
will	O
take	O
steps	O
to	O
reinforce	O
that	O
positive	O
role	O

adopting	O
a	O

the	O

from	O
the	O

We	O
firmly	O
believe	O
that	O
tension	O

undermine	O

not	O

in	O
Iraq	I-LOC

but	O
throughout	O

the	O
