Professor	O

as	O
his	O
Special	O
Adviser	O
on	O
the	O
Prevention	O

That	O
will	O
serve	O
to	O
make	O
clear	O
the	O
link	O
between	O
massive	O
and	O
systematic	O
violations	O
of	O
human	O
rights	O
and	O
threats	O
to	O
international	O
peace	O

Another	O
issue	O
of	O
serious	O
concern	O
is	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O

For	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
democrat	O
and	O
humanist	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
never	O
be	O
accepted	O

I	O

make	O
every	O

The	O
Millennium	O
Declaration	I-MISC
and	O
the	O
Millennium	O

Goals	I-MISC
are	O
at	O
the	O
core	O
of	O
the	O

efforts	O

put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O

The	O

give	O
priority	O
to	O
sustainable	O
global	O
development	O
,	O
over	O
short-term	O

will	O
be	O
the	O

Rich	O
countries	O
must	O
fulfil	O
their	O
commitments	O

I	O
am	O
proud	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
Sweden	I-LOC
will	O
reach	O
its	O
national	O
goal	O
of	O
1	O

of	O
gross	O
national	O
income	O
for	O
official	O
development	O
assistance	O
in	O
2006	O
.	O

But	O
development	O
assistance	O
alone	O
will	O
not	O
yield	O
the	O
needed	O
results	O
.	O

Both	O
the	O
developed	O
and	O
the	O
developing	O
world	O
must	O
move	O
forward	O
on	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
other	O
issues	O

And	O
Sweden	I-LOC
will	O
do	O
its	O
part	O

We	O
have	O
translated	O
the	O
international	O
agenda	O
into	O
national	O
policy	O

giving	O
the	O
entire	O

objective:	O
to	O
contribute	O
to	O
equitable	O

We	O
will	O
act	O
in	O
a	O

with	O
that	O

objective	O
in	O
every	O
field	O
,	O
whether	O

But	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
enough	O

Other	O
decisive	O
areas	O
are	O
good	O

Let	O

By	O

we	O

the	O
High-Level	O

the	O

the	O

It	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
decisive	O
moment	O
for	O
the	O
United	I-ORG

It	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
chance	O
for	O
