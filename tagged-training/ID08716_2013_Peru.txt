we	O

our	O

condemns	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
an	O

The	O

an	O
immediate	O
solution	O
to	O
the	O

ravaging	O
their	O

We	O
therefore	O
urge	O
all	O

The	O
gap	O
marginalizing	O
the	O

the	O

It	O
is	O

for	O
us	O

our	O
global	O

It	O
is	O

for	O

that	O
they	O
have	O
been	O

to	O

have	O
focused	O
perhaps	O
on	O
one	O
third	O
of	O
the	O

It	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
build	O
citizenship	O
,	O
since	O
in	O
practice	O
there	O
were	O
different	O
categories	O
of	O
Peruvians:	O
those	O
who	O
received	O

those	O
who	O

Our	O
efforts	O
must	O
be	O
directed	O
at	O
the	O
creation	O
of	O
a	O
twenty-first-century	O
State	O
,	O
a	O
State	O
that	O
serves	O
all	O

not	O
just	O
a	O
few	O

While	O
this	O

its	O
basis	O
is	O
not	O

It	O
also	O
has	O
profoundly	O
practical	O
repercussions	O
for	O
society	O
at	O

We	O
cannot	O
forget	O
that	O
a	O
State	O
that	O
does	O
not	O
serve	O
the	O
entire	O
population	O
breeds	O
and	O
exacerbates	O

as	O
such	O

that	O
reason	O

my	O

worked	O
not	O

on	O
economic	O
growth	O

in	O
all	O
areas	O

The	O
history	O

they	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
unsustainable	O

very	O

Economic	O
growth	O
is	O
a	O
means	O
and	O
not	O
an	O
end	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
indispensable	O
tool	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
sufficient	O

Our	O
people	O
,	O
especially	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
most	O

cannot	O
wait	O
indefinitely	O
for	O

without	O
the	O

the	O

In	O

,	O
that	O
will	O
set	O

a	O

That	O

why	O

the	O

political	O
concept	O
of	O
